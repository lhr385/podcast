      "content_en": "Teaching was too stressful so I left to become a lorry driver\n5 hours ago Share Save Share Save\nBBC Stuart Youens\nLucy Adams Education correspondent, BBC Scotland\nStuart Youens says that when he became a secondary school teacher 20 years ago he loved the job. But gradually the effect of budget cuts, the reduction in classroom assistants, the increase in additional support needs, and a rise in bureaucracy took its toll. Two years ago he chose to leave the profession and become a lorry driver – and says he's a lot happier in his new job. Figures seen by BBC Scotland News suggest that the number of days teachers have been absent because of stress has risen dramatically in the past six years. Unions and education experts say many teachers are leaving altogether as a result. The Scottish government says it is taking action to make sure school staff can access the necessary support.\nStuart Youens, 47, from central Scotland, says he taught in a good school but had started feeling dread at the thought of going in to work. He added he needed to get out before he \"became bitter\". He says teachers need to be able to cope with stress in the classroom, but that mobile phones, challenging behaviour and pupil disengagement have become a growing problem. Stuart says the amount of stress outside the classroom has also risen dramatically due to qualifications and increasing amounts of paperwork. \"In my view teaching should be quite a simple job and if you add layers and layers of data collecting and bureaucracy it adds stress,\" he says. \"It needs to be stripped back so teachers can get on with the job. It is a really satisfying job but we need to be able to get on with it without all these huge levels of bureaucracy.\"\nStuart Youens says driving is more relaxed than teaching\nHe says he loves being a lorry driver and does not miss life as a geography teacher, even though it paid better. \"It is difficult to compare lorry driving to teaching, they are completely different professions,\" he says. \"What I really like about driving is the simplicity. It's just so much more relaxed. \"Don't get me wrong there are stressors in any job and there are stressors in driving a big vehicle, but the folk I work with are great and if there is a problem the mechanics fix it. \"I've got that simplicity back that I felt I should have had in teaching.\" There were about 53,000 teachers in Scotland in 2023/24. Questions about the number of teacher absences due to stress were sent to every Scottish council by Reform Scotland, which describes itself as a non-partisan independent think tank and is chaired by former Labour first minister Lord Jack McConnell. It received responses to its freedom of information requests from the majority of local authorities, although a number – including Glasgow – did not respond or only provided the average number of teacher days missed. In the 14 councils which provided data for every year, the total number of days missed by teachers due to stress rose from 30,380 in 2017/18 to 41,629 last year. In Edinburgh, the number has more than doubled over the same period, from 3,594 to 8,879. Angus is among the other areas to have reported large increases.\nPA Media\nTeachers have told the BBC that their jobs are being made more difficult by increasingly difficult classroom behaviour, higher numbers of children with significant support needs, and cuts to classroom assistants, support staff and overall budgets. Education experts say that having so many experienced teachers being off long-term sick or leaving the profession altogether has a hugely detrimental impact on pupils who will then get ad hoc supply teachers or have to share teachers with other classes. Alison Payne, research director at Reform Scotland, said it wanted to get a better idea of the impact on teaching after hearing anecdotal reports of rising stress levels. She said: \"While the different recording methods used by the different councils made it difficult to get a Scotland-wide picture, individual council responses were alarming. Ms Payne said the Scottish government should investigate the issue further. \"While the growing number of teachers badly affected by stress is obviously deeply worrying on a personal level, the increasing number of days lost also represents more disruption to learning for pupils,\" she added. \"The figures don't give an indication of whether a small number of teachers have been off for long periods, which may be easier to manage in terms of securing cover, or if an increasing number of teachers are of for small amounts of time, which can be more difficult to plan around.\"\n'Making meaningful progress'",

David \"Heavy\" Whalley, who has died aged 72, served with the RAF Mountain Rescue Service for almost 40 years. During his career he attended more than 1,000 mountain incidents, dozens of air accidents and helped save hundreds of lives. Scottish Mountain Rescue described Whalley as a \"true legend\" and broadcaster Cameron McNeish said he made time for everyone.\nLast year Whalley, of Burghead in Moray, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that he had been diagnosed with stage four liver disease.\nScottish Mountain Rescue (SMR) said it was \"deeply saddened\" by the news of his death. It added: \"Heavy dedicated his life to helping others in the mountains, giving countless years of service with unwavering commitment, skill, and compassion. \"He was a leader, a mentor, and a friend to so many in the mountain rescue community and beyond. \"His knowledge, experience, and kindness left an indelible mark on all who worked alongside him.\" SMR said his legacy would live on through every team member he guided, every life he touched and \"every summit where his spirit roams free\". McNeish said his friend's death still came as a shock even though he had been ill. The writer added: \"Heavy was probably the most-liked and popular person I have ever met, a man with time for everyone and a man with a heart of gold.\"\nDavid Whalley Whalley with his dog, Teallach, on Ben Nevis\nLast year Whalley said he had \"always been a fighter\" and would battle until the end. He was affectionately known as by his nickname, \"Heavy\", which was given to him when he joined the RAF as a 5ft 4in recruit weighing just seven stone. Whalley worked as a team leader for both the RAF Leuchars and RAF Kinloss Mountain Rescue teams. He was also deputy leader at RAF Valley in North Wales and president of the Search and Rescue Dog Association Scotland (SARDA). Whalley attended more than 70 aircraft crashes and was senior team leader of the rescue effort at the scene of the Lockerbie disaster.\nGetty Images Pan Am Flight 103 was brought down on 21 December 1988\nPan Am Flight 103 was brought down on 21 December 1988, killing its 259 passengers and crew and another 11 residents in the Scottish town. Reflecting last year on the UK's worst terror attack, Whalley said: \"The place was like hell. \"It was terrible, and it was so dangerous, and there were fatalities everywhere.\" \"And I don't think people can ever imagine what that was like.\" He said the police force and the fire brigade were overwhelmed and admitted it took its toll on his mental health. Whalley recalled: \"I was just working non-stop for about a week, no sleep, nothing. \"One day afterwards I tried to get up and I was frozen, I could not move. \"I had about three or four weeks in bed.\" He said after the trauma of the disaster he fought hard for the military to offer help to rescuers who may have suffered from post-traumatic disease, which is a legacy he was proud of.\nDavid Whalley Whalley with his granddaughter, Ellie Skye, in 2013",

Joe Mulholland is planning to use them for part of a restaurant and as workshops in the Finnieston area of the city. A number of the carriages were sold to private individuals and charities after being taken out of service last year. They have been bought by nurseries, an art centre and a restaurateur. Police Scotland said inquiries into the vandalism were ongoing.\nMr Mulholland, who owns the Hidden Lane in Finnieston, said he was now facing a cleaning bill of \"several thousand pounds\" after the carriages were defaced over the course of a week. He told BBC Scotland News: \"The actual graffiti I would say is talentless. It's not as if you would say 'oh that's interesting we'll keep that'. There's nothing we would like to keep. \"I feel very angry. It would be bad enough if there were some talent being shown in it instead of just to destroy things that were very elegant in themselves. \"It has made carriages which were very elegant look cheap and tawdry.\" Mr Mulholland said the culprits entered through a locked gate and also damaged security cameras at the site. He added: \"If it had been Banksy that had put it on, I probably would have considered keeping it but none of these are on the same planet as Banksy.\"\nThe owner said removing the graffiti will be costly",

The pandemic had put a stop to live touring with Ocean Colour Scene, with whom he had played since 2016. And without recording studios, he was unable to continue with his successful solo career. But there was a further barrier for the bassist, who has been playing since he was in school. \"I'd started to get these really intense pins and needles in my hands. It was like throwing a snowball and then running your hands under hot water afterwards. It's really painful and hot.\" \"And then it spread to my feet.\"\nGetty Images Raymond (far right) has played with Ocean Colour Scene since 2013.\nIn August that year, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) which affects the central nervous system. \"It was almost a relief to have the diagnosis because it allowed me to make the necessary adjustments and get on with my life.\" But he was also concerned that his professional career might be over. \"The day they told me I had MS, I thought I was done. I wasn't even 40 at that point and I thought I'd have to sell my guitars and find some other way to make a living. \"But the neurologist said, 'Give it time'.\" Within two months, he was on a new treatment, and ready to leave hospital. Ocean Colour Scene had just announced their first tour in almost two years – and Meade was keen to be part of it. \"My hands didn't work. I couldn't tie my laces. I couldn't do a zip up - I was dropping everything. \"To have something to aim for was important.\" He called the other band members - Simon Fowler, Steve Cradock and Oscar Harrison - and told them what had happened.\n'Outpouring of emotion'\n\"I said I was aware that I might not get back to the level of being able to perform live, but they just said 'Get fit, see you in December'.\" The gig in the band's home city of Birmingham was an emotional one, for them and the audience. But Meade was just focused on getting through the set. \"I had a stool hidden behind an amp and I thought if I can get through this without sitting down, I'll be doing ok. In the end I didn't need it. And there was this outpouring of emotion. It was such a terrible time and it was a release to get back to playing live music.\" \"We all had a hug when we came off stage.\" Having returned to live touring, Meade had another challenge to face. Making his own music. \"I couldn't hold a pen – which means I can't do my crossword either. My head was just scrambled with too much information. I made the mistake of googling MS and I was just swamped with information. \"The thing to remember is that no one - with my brain - has ever had this before so I needed to find out what's right for me.\"\nRaymond Meade Raymond made it to the OCS gig in Birmingham and admits it was \"emotional\"\nHe started to train his brain with games like chess, and slowly the songwriting abilities returned. The result is his first new single since his diagnosis, Holy Water, which has been released on Alan McGee's new label Creation Youth. For a boy who grew up in the southside of Glasgow, idolising Oasis, and later ran Liam Gallagher's clothes label Pretty Green, it was a dream moment. \"I used to send him demo cassettes. It's a full circle moment. And to be writing again and to have that music released by Alan McGee meant everything.\" \"I'd never thought I'd get back to playing with the band and writing my own music, being able to record it and being at a level that Alan McGee finds it worthy of releasing.\" This week he and the rest of Ocean Colour Scene kick off their latest tour in Leeds. The band whose hits include The Riverboat Song and The Day We Caught the Train will play two dates at Glasgow's 02 Academy on 15 and 16 April. Another dream come true for the boy who saw the band as a teenager at the Glasgow Barrowlands.\nRaymond Meade Raymond has released his first single since his diagnosis - Holy Water",

His comments came after the UK government announced an extra £500m for road maintenance in England. Swinney said his administration was providing an additional £1bn in funding for councils in the 2025-26 budget. Drivers from Glasgow to Cape Wrath in the Highlands have protested about potholes last year.\nUnder plans announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, councils in England will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress. Swinney told BBC Scotland News: \"We fulfilled the request of local government for a real-terms increase in their core funding, so they could tackle issues such as potholes and other issues. \"The Scottish government has adequately and fully funded local government to make sure these issues, such as potholes, can be tackled in our local communities so that we can invest in our public infrastructure and meet the needs of the public.\"\nPA Media John Swinney says his government has listened to calls for increased local authority funding\nCash-strapped councils, struggling to meet the costs of delivering public services, have faced more vocal complaints about the state of roads in recent years. Campaigners in Caithness claimed the problem was so bad people were leaving the area. Council umbrella body Cosla said local authorities were committed to keeping roads for which they were responsible safe and carried out critical maintenance \"where necessary\". A spokesperson added: \"Council finances are under intense pressure, and while the £54m cut to councils' capital budget in 2024/25 was reversed in 25/26 there is only a further increase of £11m, this has had an impact on local authorities' capital programmes. \"This means that the capital grant to meet the high standards and efficiency for essential services, including road maintenance, stands at only £777m to support and maintain assets worth an estimated £55bn.\" Scottish Conservative shadow transport secretary Sue Webber said: \"John Swinney is living on a different planet if he thinks he's giving Scotland's councils the funds needed to fix our pothole-scarred roads. \"Motorists can see the appalling state of our roads, after years of savage SNP government cuts to councils - and the investment now needed to put it right.\"\nSwinney also raised concerns about the UK government Spring Statement on Wednesday, in which Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce further spending cuts. He said that \"essential\" funding for public services in Scotland might be cut, warning that would be a \"serious threat\" to efforts to tackle poverty and invest in the NHS. The Labour administration has already announced plans to cut the welfare budget by £5bn a year, largely from slashing support for disabled people and on incapacity benefits. Swinney said: \"I literally cannot believe that a Labour government is going to punish some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"\nPA Media Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce cuts in the Spring Statement this week",

Matilda Jr was due to be performed at the SEC in Glasgow from Tuesday until Saturday, using two different groups of children. However, performing arts academy GAMTA only had rights for the show in venues with a capacity under 400 - but the SEC's Lomond Suite seats 497. The rights holders - understood to be Music Theatre International Europe - then revoked the licence, meaning a group of young performers suddenly learned their three weekend shows were scrapped.\nOne group of children handled shows from Tuesday to Thursday, with the second cast to start their run on Friday. The disappointment, first reported by Glasgow Live, prompted parents to post on social media that it resulted in tears from young cast members. Caroline Hendoe's daughter Scarlett, 12, was one of the second group of students who only performed once in the show, which is a slimmed down one hour adaptation of the successful stage musical, based on Roald Dahl's book. She told BBC Scotland News she felt the rights holders should have made an exception for the sake of the children. Carloline said: \"While they may be technically right, the emotional cost of their decision is immeasurable. \"These young performers have spent months rehearsing, pouring their hearts into this production, only to have their dreams shattered. \"The right thing to do would have been to find a resolution that didn't punish the children for an administrative mistake - the kids deserved better.\" Ms Hendoe added that her daughter was taking part with GAMTA for the first time and had spent three months rehearsing and preparing for the show.\n'Deeply sorry'",

Argyll and Bute Council decided earlier this month to build a new £43m campus close to the current high school in Tobermory. Many parents wanted a more central location so that pupils in the south of the island would no longer have to travel by ferry to Oban for schooling and stay in hostels during the week. The online petition, which has received nearly 700 signatures, suggests the decision ignores children's rights to a family life. The council has been approached for comment.\nThe location of the island's only high school has long been a source of division on Mull. Pupils living in the north go to the school in Tobermory, but the commute is more than 90 minutes for those living in the south, and most travel to Oban on the mainland, staying in hostels during the week. Campaigners had argued for a new secondary school to be built in a more central location such as Craignure, while keeping a primary school in Tobermory. But the council said splitting the campus would cost the authority an extra £12m, and that any further delay could jeopardise promised Scottish government funding.\nRob Claxton-Ingham, who started the petition believes some of the information presented to councillors who took the decision was misleading. He said: \"There would be shared costs - the development could share the costs of developing infrastructure rather than charging Argyll and Bute.\"\nChermaine Laurie is among parents on the island who fear they may have to move to avoid being separated from their children",

The former sheriff court and prison is being redeveloped as a visitor attraction at a cost of about £30m, and is due to open later this year. High Life Highland (HLH), which will operate the site, has released the ticket prices which range from the cheapest - £14 for a child - to up to £65 for a family of two adults and three children. HLH said deals would be available to Highland residents.\nThe redevelopment has received funding from the £315m Inverness and Highland City Region Deal. Called the Inverness Castle Experience, it will have an interactive \"journey\" taking visitors through the history of the Highlands.\nHow much will tickets cost?\nHLH said tickets would be cheaper if booked online in advance. The costs include: Adult - £20 (online)/£22\nSeniors - £18/£20\nChild - £14/£16\nFamily (two adults and two children) - £46/£54\nFamily (two adults and three children) £55/£65 HLH said Highland residents who pay for its High Life Highland card would have access to more booking options, and 10% discount on food and drinks after purchasing full-price tickets.\nIan Brown, a councillor and co-chairman of Inverness Castle Delivery Group, has welcomed ticket deals for Highland residents. He added: \"The Inverness Castle Experience is set to become a key landmark in the region and ensuring that our Highland communities can enjoy it throughout the year is a great move. \"This initiative encourages local engagement and fosters pride in our heritage and Highland stories.\" The Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service moved out of the castle in 2020, and Highland Council has been leading the revamp. Last month, public agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) put an extra £863,000 towards the project.\nWhat is the castle's history?\nGetty Images An etching of the castle and Inverness' riverside from the mid-19th Century\nThe sandstone Inverness Castle was built in 1836 to plans drawn by architect William Burn. It was constructed on a mound overlooking the city and the River Ness. In 1848, a building known as the North Block was added and served as a prison. But a castle had occupied the site from possibly as far back as the 11th Century. Over the centuries, the fortification fell under the control of the forces of Edward I, Robert the Bruce and James I, II and IV. In 1562, it was attacked and damaged by soldiers loyal to Mary, Queen of Scots, before it was almost destroyed by Royalist troops in the 1600s. Bonnie Prince Charlie's forces blew the castle up in 1746 to prevent it from falling into the hands of government troops. It was said that a French sergeant, who had brought his poodle with him to Scotland, set off the explosives. The soldier was caught in the blast, and his body was blown across to the opposite side of the River Ness. His dog survived.",

The mother-of-two from Peterhead gave birth to her daughter Ivy in May 2020, right in the midst of the Covid lockdown and was isolated for many of the weeks leading up to and after giving birth. Her son Luca was born in 2023 in much more normal circumstances. Five years on from the beginning of lockdown, Stacie told BBC Scotland News her second baby helped her get over the trauma of giving birth during a pandemic.\nHospital maternity wards were placed under strict regulations in March 2020. Expectant mothers had to wear face masks and no visitors were allowed. It was not known how the virus could affect pregnant women. Stacie describes the arrivals of Ivy and Luca as \"day and night.\" She said: \"They were similar in the sense that they were both sections, they were both on the larger side but that's pretty much the only similarities between them.\"\nStacie Buchan Stacie's partner Fraser was allowed to stay during her second birth\nStacie's partner Fraser wasn't allowed to be in the hospital ward for her first labour. That meant she had to make decisions and face procedures such as being induced alone - at a time when she felt \"very vulnerable\". Fraser was able to be with her in the operating theatre and then in the recovery room for an hour or two, before being told he had to leave. Stacie spent her first five days of motherhood alone, apart from the midwives working in the hospital. \"I still to this day think that whole experience of having Ivy in lockdown contributed somewhat to my postpartum depression,\" she said. \"I can't say for definite but I do think it had a lasting impact on me emotionally,\" she said.\nFear of giving birth alone\nIt wasn't until she became pregnant again in 2023, that Stacie realised the long-term influence the first experience had on her. \"There was a fear that stemmed from Ivy's pregnancy that I thought was put to bed, but it wasn't until I was pregnant again with Luca that I realised it hadn't.\" Stacie said even though she knew the pandemic was over, she spent most of her second pregnancy worried about having to give birth alone. She ended up having to be signed off from work early. But when the time came to give birth it was a completely different experience. This time, Fraser was allowed to stay in the ward for the duration and when they got home the family were able to welcome visitors to meet baby Luca.\nStacie Buchan Ivy is now four, and her little brother Luca is one.",

In his hometown of Dumfries, however, he is involved in a smaller venture as an owner of a little pub which is helping the local music scene to thrive. He is part of a group called To The Nines which bought the Coach and Horses on the Whitesands a couple of years ago. It has been praised by bands, music organisations and people working to revive the town centre for the boost it is giving to the south of Scotland town where the global superstar grew up.\nThe Coach and Horses on the Whitesands in Dumfries has bands playing most weekends\nHarris - whose real name is Adam Wiles - has previously shown a commitment to the area where he was raised when he offered to help out workers affected by the closure of a fish factory in Annan. He is listed under his real name as a director of To The Nines Ltd, along with his friend Mark Irving. A report in The Sun recently highlighted how he had gone back to his home town to make his investment. Title deeds show the group bought the Coach and Horses in August 2023 for £190,000 and it has continued to build on its reputation as a local music venue. The pub is one of a growing number of venues in Dumfries helping give a platform to local bands.\nHagen Patterson, director of the Dumfries Music Collective (DMC) which aims to provide musical opportunities to young people in the region, said they had always recognised the Coach and Horses as an \"iconic grassroots music venue\". \"We have witnessed some great artistry to come out of the pub over many years,\" he said. He said it could offer a \"leg up\" to local artists and it was great that such a worldwide star had helped allow it to do so. \"Performing live for the first time, even if just for a handful of listeners, provides invaluable experience,\" he said. \"It's a chance to try out brand new material, gauge reactions, and build a local fan base. \"We are delighted that Calvin and Mark have ensured the longevity of the Coach and Horses, this helps foster our scene.\"\nKissing the Flint Kissing the Flint performed at the Coach and Horses earlier this month\nKissing The Flint recently played at the pub having started gigging in Dumfries a few years ago having moved from Australia. The band's Leah Chynoweth-Tidy said the site had quickly won their hearts. \"All the staff are so supportive and welcoming, really love their live music and are super proud of their historic, vibrant wee venue, which well they should be,\" she said. \"It's always a fantastic experience playing there as the audience are open to any kind of genre and are incredibly responsive and enthusiastic about our original music, which is becoming a rarer thing these days in many venues. \"The Coach feels like coming home for us every time we play there, and all who sail in her have become part of our music family.\"\nSandy Robertson Andy McMillan said the pub owned by Calvin Harris was an \"awesome grass roots venue\"\nAndy McMillan, frontman with Dumfries three-piece the Dogz, has similar praise. \"The Coach is an awesome grassroots venue,\" he said. \"All the staff are passionate about live music and supporting local bands, whether established acts or those just cutting their teeth in front of an audience. \"It's always a top gig for us and although it's a small venue its contribution to the local music scene is huge.\"\nGetty Images Harris plays huge venues now but started out with much smaller gigs\nJust along the road from the pub, Rab Smith runs the record shop Domino Entertainment and is a former chairman of the town's retailers' association. He said he believed the area could be at the heart of boosting nightlife in Dumfries. \"The whole Whitesands could be a great entertainment centre,\" he said. \"The old tourist board building could be spectacular.\" He also said it was good to see a local boy made good like Harris putting something back into the community. \"It is a great wee pub - it is too small to be a King Tut's - but it is great that somebody is putting money into it and keeping it alive,\" he added.\nRichie Nicoll Richie Nicoll chairs Dumfries Town Board looking at ways of regenerating the town centre",

Their debut album, Raintown, referring to Glasgow, spawned what is probably their most popular hit, Dignity, which is still regularly played at parties and has even been adopted by Dundee United fans. Forty years on, the band are still together - after a brief hiatus - and are releasing a new album, The Great Western Road. The album title gives a nod to the places they used to meet up for gigs back in the day and also serves as a metaphor for their lives. \"I was thinking about these big roads and avenues that lead out of Glasgow and at the time of life we're at it's this unknown ending,\" singer Ricky Ross tells BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. \"You have to think about these things so it became an interesting metaphor - the idea that you just don't know what's round the corner. It's also quite exciting.\"\nGetty Images The band began when Ross got together with drummer Dougie Vipond\nRoss, a former teacher, points out that a lot has changed in 40 years, not least the music industry, which has changed almost beyond recognition. To celebrate this, and to mark their milestone, the band are releasing a cassette version of the new album. \"That's causing people quite a lot of amusement as they can't find a cassette player,\" Ross says. The band formed in the summer of 1985 - when Ross moved from Dundee to Glasgow - taking their name from the 1977 Steely Dan song Deacon Blues. Original members included Ross, singer Lorraine McIntosh - who married Ross in 1990 - drummer Dougie Vipond, keyboard player James Prime and guitarist Graeme Kelling. \"This all started when Dougie and I got together,\" Ross adds. \"Over the last 40 years our lives have changed and things have gone in different directions for everyone but those of us who started it are very, very close. \"They are the closest people in my life. We all created something very special when we started.\"\nGetty Images The band are incorporating smaller theatre shows into their current tour\nRoss says he really appreciates the older fans who still come to the gigs but is also pleased to see younger fans in their audiences. \"I am very grateful that people are still coming – that they've come all these years to see us,\" he says. \"They are the core audience but its lovely that they've passed this on to other people as well. \"We were playing at the Albert Hall a couple of years ago – there were four guys in their early 20s and I thought 'are they taking the mickey here?' but they were for real and that was quite nice.\" The band are currently playing a string of gigs around the UK and Ireland, some of which are in smaller theatres. \"We wanted to do the new record and a lot of the songs we haven't got the chance to do when we play bigger shows,\" Ross says. \"But we're coming back later in the year – playing in Aberdeen and a couple of shows at the Hydro in Glasgow - when we'll do everything, all manner of things, which we always try to do. \"You always want to make people feel that they've got the best of you.\"",

The Lanarkshire singer's piano-led songs have seen him sell out gigs across the country and earn support slots with major bands. But he's decided to wait before bringing out any music so he can \"build a real fan base\". \"I just find it insane that people are wanting to come see me without any music being out,\" admits the teenager, who is from Uddingston.\nHowever, his unusual approach hasn't stopped him being backed by Lewis Capaldi, who has worked on a tune with the 18-year-old after a mutual connection in the music industry helped set up a collaboration between the two. \"Lewis has been absolutely class with me,\" he told BBC Scotland News. \"We met a few times and have now written a song together. When I was starting out I was covering his songs and now we're writing together - it's a bit mad to have people at that level interested in what I'm doing musically.\" Other than video clips shared on social media, no-one can hear Kerr's sensitive piano-led songs - a deliberate decision. \"I've seen so many artists on TikTok firing out a song a week but then not be selling out 200-capacity venues\", he explains. \"I'd rather sell out a tour than have a million streams on Spotify. One thing that'll never change is that real people want to go see gigs so I've just done lots of shows and supported folk. \"We did two headlines in Glasgow, selling out King Tut's. Then it was Saint Lukes, which is double the size of Tut's, and then a UK tour. I spoke to a few people and decided to try to push it out further with another tour.\"\nGetty Images Sam Cooke is a huge inspiration for Kerr\nThat tour will end on Sunday at the Garage in Glasgow, his biggest hometown gig yet. He jokes most of the people coming to those gigs are family members, which gently plays down his growing popularity. However, he has had plenty of family backing, taking singing and piano lessons as a child and getting a taste of the arts by appearing in pantomimes as a youngster, treading the boards at the Pavillion theatre. It came naturally to someone who admits he was \"always the class clown\" at school, and enjoyed being the centre of attention. By the age of 10 he was singing at a local song club, performing a Queen track on his first appearance. His musical roots come from the school run, however. \"I was in primary school in Uddingston and my sister was in secondary at Uddingstoon Grammar, so I had half an hour to wait before my grandad picked her up. He had a Sam Cooke record that would just play and before I knew it, I had all the words off by heart.\" That led to a love of classic soul - Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Etta James - that Kerr says is \"imprinted\" in his music to this day.\nThe Small Print PR Kerr Mercer started off playing open mic nights\nWhile he can't credit his family with blessing him with musical genes (\"there's not much music in my family other than karaoke\" he laughs) that hasn't stopped parents Kirsty and Robert offering support. And in his mum's case, some criticism... \"I could do the Brits and she'd tell me if I wasn't good,\" he says. \"As soon as I write a new song I'll send it to my mum and dad first. My dad is chill, he likes everything but me and my mum are very similar, so if I've not done my best, she'll tell me. \"I've played to thousands supporting Tom Walker and my mum was like 'you weren't at your best tonight' but then other times she goes 'that was outstanding'. \"More people are now telling me everything's going amazing but I only believe I've done well if I get the seal of approval from my mum.\"\n'Myles Smith called me a melt'\nHe has been backed by far more than his family now, having racked up support slots with a number of pop music heavyweights like Teddy Swims and Myles Smith. The advice of Stargazing singer Smith - the man with the best-selling British single in 2024 - has provided a big boost to Kerr, even if those words of wisdom are sometimes delivered tongue in cheek. \"I was home for Christmas and not sure what to do now that the tour was over. I got a message from Myles that simply read 'why don't you release a song, ya melt'. \"He's great though. It's not like the support act is always chilling with the headliner, but Myles was amazing about it. I was sitting in my dressing room and Myles burst in and was like 'why are you here, come have a beer with us' - then we would just sit talking about songs.\" He's now writing with an array of collaborators, and starting to record material with the aim of finally releasing songs later this year, adding that he's being a \"perfectionist\" about what should come out after such a wait. \"It's great fun too – you go for a day, write a song together and then go to the pub. There's not many jobs where you get put with two people you've never met, have a therapy session and then write a song about it.\"\nEPA Kerr has toured with the American rapper Teddy Swims",

      "content_en": "Peter Mullan's return to the stage is a one-off: 'I can't afford it'\n4 days ago Share Save Pauline McLean BBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Share Save\nGetty Images Peter Mullan has tended to avoid theatre due to the low wages\nWhen Peter Mullan steps on stage as legendary football manager Bill Shankly on Friday night, it will be for the first time in more than 30 years. Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success. There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan. \"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says. \"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.\nPA Media There is a statue to legendary football manager Bill Shankly outside Anfield\n\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\" Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus. The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book. The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced. \"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"\nPA Media Scottish football manager Bill Shankly was credited with transforming Liverpool FC into one of Europe's leading clubs.\nThe wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice. \" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says. \"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\" That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage. At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play. \"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"\nClara Mbirini In rehearsals for Red or Dead in Liverpool which opens on Friday night\nBorn in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\". He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow. He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give. After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor. He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\nGetty Images Mullan has worked steadily in film and television, including recent Amazon Prime blockbuster series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\nMore recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party. Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry. \"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea. \"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\" He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty). \"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"\nGetty Images As a director, Mullan picked up a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for The Magdalene Sisters\nNormal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team. Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football. \"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\" It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive. \"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein – those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much. Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism? \"There's Alex Ferguson, who has lived to a ripe old age, but he's in the same camp. The last of those committed, nothing-else-but-football managers. They live and breathe it.\"\nGetty Images Mullan says Red or Dead is as much about fanaticism as it is about football",

      "content_en": "Colin: Once again this team underperformed and let us supporters down. How a manager can continually pick players who are not playing weekly club football is unacceptable. This team is slow all over the park, no players with pace or dribbling skills, not one can beat a player one on one. We all can see who needs to go, there must be young hungry players out there with pace and determination. As soon as we concede a goal, we are in trouble. No creativity whatsoever, too many midfielders playing the same way.\nDavid: Clarke got it all wrong. I was his biggest fan but he's not making it easy to support him. His stubbornness is costing us games. Ralston gets targeted every match, yet he keeps playing. Che Adams was terrible both games, losing possession constantly - no sub at half time. Christie was way off it - subbed too late. Meanwhile, Greece made changes as that what you need to do to get a different performance, and it worked. Clarke did nothing, not even at half-time which was criminal. Then he took off Gilmour, our best in midfield, and everything fell apart. His refusal to adapt is holding us back.\nMichael: That's probably the worst performance under Clarke. After the initial 10 minutes, we were totally devoid of ideas for how to break the Greeks down, physically lacked the pace and strength to compete, didn't pass or break with any speed or conviction and worst of all had absolutely no passion to lift the crowd.\nTony: Scotland were absolutely hopeless. Their long balls went nowhere or out of play. There was no energy or class on display. They were well and deservedly beaten.\nPeter: We made it so easy for Greece. A team with really decent players who punished us for a truly woeful performance. Instead of moving forward, we have fallen down another hole... Embarrassing!\nPatrick: I hate that phrase bump in the road. This was a pot hole.\nSteven: Confidence was high ahead of the game, but what a shocking performance after a great result in Greece. Could barely string two passes together. Congratulations to Greece. They looked better than us all over the pitch. It could've been more than three.\nKenny: It looked as though we were playing with 10 men and they had 12 as every time we had the ball there was nobody to pass to other than backwards. Also they looked fitter and sharper and with an plan of attack. We looked clueless and had Christie who is left footed playing on the right which further exposed Ralston in the first half.\nHenry: Manager is hopeless. Fails to retain Lewis Ferguson (our best player in the first leg), plays Christie out of position. Continues to pick McLean, who is obviously not international class. Failure last night all down to midfield but essentially we need a new leader on the touchline.\nAlan: Playing Adams up front on his own with no other Scot within 30m of him is never going to work. The midfield needed to be nearer to him.\nAllen: Most of Clarke's trusted players let themselves down. He should play players in their club positions not try to shoehorn them into systems they don't fit.\nWilliam: Clarke must go. Totally negative football, boring to watch. Gone backwards in my opinion. No fight or passion.",

They head into this week's Worlds - which you can watch on the BBC - among the favourites for the podium in a season where they claimed Britain's first ever medal at the Grand Prix final.\nTorvill and Dean have been following their progress with interest for several years since first meeting them on the ice at Alexandra Palace, when the youngsters asked them to look at the programme they were working on.\n\"We sort of added a few little moves here and there, but I think what struck us right at the beginning was how well matched they were as a team, in stature and personality and ability,\" Dean said.\nFear, 25, and Gibson, 30, have continued to improve year on year, winning fans with their crowd-pleasing style of ice dance but also impressing judges with their technical skills.\nSo, could Fear and Gibson's Beyonce moves be about to finally take over from Torvill and Dean's Bolero and provide some new skating role models in Britain?\n\"We're retiring this year, so it would be nice to just hand that on to them,\" Dean said.\nWhat is different this year is that they have beaten some of their main podium rivals, including placing higher than world champions Madison Chock and Evan Bates to win Skate America and end a 15-year streak of American dominance.\n\"It's momentum in competition,\" Dean said. \"There's the word of mouth around the events, the judges, the panel, the public perception of them, how the audience react - it does influence.\"\nAs well as targeting Worlds success, Fear and Gibson have next year's Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina in sight.\nThe World Championships in Boston is a qualifying event for the Games, with quota places up for grabs.\nThey run from 25 to 30 March, with Fear and Gibson in action on Friday in the rhythm dance and Saturday in the free dance. The scores from both programmes are added together for the final result.\nTheir main podium rivals are likely to be Chock and Bates - who are going for a third title in a row - Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier and European champions Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri of Italy.",

      "content_en": "The freedoms ushered in a decade ago allow people to take 25% of their retirement pot as a tax-free lump sum when they hit 55. They also permit older savers to take an ongoing income as a pension drawdown, or use some or all of their pension to buy a lifetime income with an annuity. Savers can also choose to mix and match.\nHowever, planning how and when to start taking money out of pensions remains “one of the most complex challenges of later life”, according to Royal London which said the changes have forced consumers to make “difficult decisions that could affect their standard of living for many years to come”.\nA survey commissioned by the mutual and investment company, published today, found more than two in five (42%) of those aged 50 or over said they worried about running out of retirement.\nRead more:\nBut despite the complexities involved in managing pension cash through retirement, the survey found that older savers are taking money out of their pension without seeking advice or finding out what tax they will have to pay. Only four in 10 (37%) of those with a defined contribution (DC) or personal pension considered whether taking out a lump sum would mean they paid more tax or moved them into a higher tax bracket. Just four in 10 (39%) took advice from a financial adviser.\nIn addition, nearly one in five (18%) of those eligible to make a withdrawal had not taken any advice at all, whether from financial professionals or family and friends, before taking money out of their pension. Only 20% of consumers aged 50 or over with a DC or personal pension made use of guidance from Pension Wise, the government-backed advisory service.\n“Pension freedoms were designed to give consumers more flexibility and choice about their retirement, and they’ve certainly done that,” said Clare Moffat, pensions and tax expert at Royal London. “Despite comments at the time that people could buy a Lamborghini with their retirement pot if they so wished, we’ve found little evidence of people doing so. However, the changes have also left consumers making difficult decisions that could affect their standard of living for many years to come.\n“It is concerning that so few people took financial advice or made use of free guidance services, such as Pension Wise. Worryingly, our research shows that many made decisions that may not have been in their best interests over the longer-term.\n“It demonstrates why there’s a need for more people to access the right level of support, including from their pension provider; something that the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, is exploring this year.\n“We would encourage people facing complex financial decisions to take advice from a financial adviser - it could be time, and money, well spent.”\nIn other findings, nearly 8% took their tax-free cash lump sum within six months of their 55th birthday, which is currently the earliest age at which most people can access money from their pension.",

The flight also garnered significant interest online, with thousands tracking its journey on flight tracking site Flightradar24.\nWhile at Prestwick, the aircraft underwent a livery overhaul, with Airbourne Colours - Europe’s only privately-owned aircraft painting specialists in commercial and corporate aircraft painting, repainting and refinishing - completing the initial phase of the new livery identity.\nThe A380 then departed Prestwick for Dresden in October last year to undergo heavy maintenance - including mandatory inspections and component replacements - at Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH, a joint venture between Airbus and ST Engineering.\nFollowing the departure, Richard Stephenson, director of Global Airlines, expressed his hope of a return to Scotland for the airline in the near future.\nHe told The Herald: \"Our first A380 arrived at Prestwick Airport. It’s been well cared for in Scotland and we would like to thank everyone who played their part in its journey to this point.\n\"We are getting closer to launching our commercial flights and we hope it will not be long before a Global Airlines A380 is back in Scotland.”",

      "content_en": "John Swinney has repeatedly given his absolute commitment to protecting free university tuition in Scotland. But is it now time for a rethink?\nFree tuition has come under increasing scrutiny in recent weeks after the scale of financial pressures was laid bare.\nDundee University revealed it is on the \"brink of insolvency\", facing a £35 million deficit and more than 600 jobs facing the axe.\nEdinburgh University, meanwhile, plans to cut £140 million to avoid a deficit.\nEight universities in total reported an operational deficit for 2023-24, up from four in the previous year and revealing the precarious and challenging times ahead for the higher education sector.\nSo what are the solutions?\nAn Ipsos UK survey suggests almost half of Scots favoured means testing university tuition fees so that low income or disadvantaged households are prioritised.\nUniversities are paid £1,820 per Scottish student each year to cover the cost of free tuition and institutions instead have to rely on fee-paying international students to plug the gap.\nInternational students are charged varying fees in Scotland - from around £10,000 to up to £40,000 per year.\nFor prestigious universities like St Andrews and Edinburgh, where there were more international students last year than Scottish-domiciled students, it allows them to rake in significant fees to offset the funding gap.\nBut there's a problem. It leaves them vulnerable as the number of foreign students fall.\nOverseas student numbers dropped by more than 10,000 last year, significantly exacerbating the financial strain on universities.\nAnd so it has been suggested that charging the wealthiest Scots for their universities fees could help struggling universities out of the hole.\nBut we know this is never going to happen.\nFormer first minister Alex Salmond said \"rocks would melt in the sun\" before he would ever considering introducing fees for Scottish students after he implemented the policy in 2007.\nAnd 18 years later, the discourse hasn't changed. Mr Swinney told The Herald on Monday there was no situation that would result in tuition fees being scrapped.\nThe First Minister described free tuition as \"important\" in allowing students from poorer backgrounds to attend.\nRead more from Unspun:\nSNP relief as Nicola Sturgeon cleared by Police Scotland\nDoes Netflix show explain young voters turning to Reform?\nSNP MSP faces de-selection amid Operation Branchform probe\nThird of SNP MSPs stepping down leaves Swinney at crossroads\nThere's numbers to back this up. Figures show 16.7% of entrants in 2023-24 came from the country's 20% most deprived communities - up from 16.3%.\nAnd even if there was a change in government, tuition fees would be safe.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar - the only other likely contender for first minister in 2026 - described free university tuition as one of the \"successes of devolution\".\nThere's another thing both agree on though. The current situation isn't sustainable.\nJohn Swinney has instead said the UK Government must look at \"removing some of the barriers\" preventing international students coming to Scotland.\nHe pinpoints the reason for dwindling international student numbers on immigration changes such as ending the inclusion of family members on student visas.\nScrapping tuition fees might not be the solution for easing the financial strain on universities, but maybe it is time politicians started having conversations on what will.",

We went 22 months without winning a local council by-election and we’ve just won five seats in 2025 already.\n“So, I think electorally we’re doing better.\n“All the things I said to the party we would do, the heavy lifting that’s required to get ready for 2026, is all happening.\n“We’re building up and working very hard to win in 2026, which is what I intend to do.”\nScottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: \"This SNP government has lost its way and run out of ideas.\n\"From the crisis in our NHS to the violence in our schools, the SNP has left every institution in Scotland weaker.\n\"This is not as good as it gets, and in 2026 Scotland will have a chance to put a stop to SNP decline and vote for a fresh start with Scottish Labour.\n\"Scottish Labour will be working tirelessly to earn voters' trust and demonstrate that we can deliver the new direction Scotland so desperately needs.\"",

      "content_en": "The Glasgow-headquartered business has announced the successful operation of its “Beta” prototype system which produced hydrogen continuously from water via its Decoupled Electrolysis process for the first time.\nThe test comprised of operating scaled up versions of the two main sub-systems together under manual control. The next step is to build the fully integrated prototype with a control system which the team expect to achieve later in 2025.\nThe development comes hot on the heels of Clyde Hydrogen achieving its first \"major\" technology milestone, announced in December 2024, when the business demonstrated it successfully produced hydrogen at pressures exceeding 100 bar using its scaled-up catalytic hydrogen generator.\nREAD MORE:\nMove to 'supercharge' Scotland's deep tech start-up scene revealed\nScots technology chief reveals investment target\nScottish golf technology company prepares to go to the next level\nClyde Hydrogen is a spin-out from the University of Glasgow’s School of Chemistry, a global leader in electrochemistry research. Its cutting-edge technology utilises a decoupled electrolysis process, including an electrochemical reductor which generates a reduced mediator solution and a catalytic hydrogen generator that produces high-pressure hydrogen gas.\nClyde Hydrogen said the successful demonstration of a semi-integrated prototype which can produce hydrogen continuously represents a \"significant technical validation\" of its technology, which is designed to convert low-quality, intermittent renewable power into clean hydrogen.\nJames Peck, CEO of Clyde Hydrogen, commented: “This is an important step for the team as it enables us to demonstrate that the system works continuously and gives confidence that we can begin the build of the full prototype in preparation for a commercial pilot project next year.”\nClyde Hydrogen is on track to deliver a fully integrated pilot system in 2025, and following this, plans to scale up to a commercial demonstrator, with the first market-ready product targeted for release by 2027.\nLast month, the business signed a memorandum of understanding with Hebrides-based green hydrogen producer and distributor, PlusZero, to demonstrate its \"groundbreaking\" decoupled electrolyser technology for the first time outside of the laboratory.\nBacked by pre-seed funding from Zinc, the University of Glasgow and grants from the Scottish Government’s Hydrogen Innovation Scheme (HIS) and the Net Zero Technology Centre (NZTC), Clyde Hydrogen is now ready to accelerate its growth.\nTo support its journey toward commercialisation, Clyde Hydrogen has launched a new funding round aimed at attracting up to £5m of new investment. The funds will enable the company to refine its production process, develop a production-ready system in 2026, and expand its team to meet the growing demand for hydrogen technology.",

      "content_en": "Mactaggart & Mickel has released the final block of apartments at Stewart Gardens, ready to move into now, with full LBTT paid and flooring throughout.\nPauline and Marc Cushing purchased a four bedroom Argyll duplex apartment in Stewart Gardens in November 2023, after a change in family circumstances led them to reconsider their needs. Previously, they lived in a spacious five bedroom detached home, also in Newton Mearns, with their two children Hayden (17) and Ayla (14) and Pauline’s elderly mother.\nAs their children grew older, and Pauline’s mother sadly passed away, the need for space lessened and they began their search for something different. “We loved our previous home, but it was simply too big for us,” Pauline explained.\n“After my mum passed, the house felt impractical, and with three levels, cleaning was a nightmare. We started looking for something that suited our needs better but still had enough space for our family.”\nMarc was immediately drawn to the apartments at Stewart Gardens, relishing the idea of a more manageable home that still maintained a luxurious feel. “When we first visited, I wasn’t sure if an apartment would work for a family of four,” Pauline admits. “But when we saw the space and layout, especially the size of the bedrooms, we were blown away.”\nThe generous room sizes were a huge selling point. “We wanted three big bedrooms, which is almost impossible to find,” Pauline continued. “The apartment solved that problem perfectly. Our son has the master bedroom downstairs, our daughter has a fantastic-sized room, and ours is so spacious that we even have a sofa and TV.”\nThe transition from a house to an apartment was a significant change, particularly with no garden, but it has proved to be a welcome one. “Marc has never been a fan of gardening, so he loves that we don’t have to worry about it anymore,” Pauline laughed. “And the balcony gets the sun all day, even in Scotland. It’s a lovely spot to relax.”\nThey’ve even made a few customisations to make their home their own, adding a wall to separate the kitchen from the living area for a cosier feel, and repurposing the fourth bedroom as a snug and office space. “The flexibility of the layout has been fantastic,” Pauline adds. “We also have so much storage, more than we did in our old house!”\nStewart Gardens’ location has allowed them to stay within the community they love. “We’re still a 15-minute walk from The Avenue shopping centre and the supermarket, which is great,” Pauline said. “There are plenty of buses nearby, making it easy for the kids to get to school or into town. The East Renfrewshire schools are also ranked some of the best in the country.”\nAs for the future, Pauline and Marc see their new apartment as their forever home. “With the lift access, even if we struggled with stairs in the future, we could easily adapt. We have more than enough space for the kids and even future grandchildren,” she said. “Honestly, we couldn’t be happier with our decision.”\nStewart Gardens’ premium residences boast open-plan layouts, spacious rooms, and high-quality finishes, ensuring a perfect balance of functionality and sophistication. Every apartment benefits from two allocated parking spaces, secure video entry, and lift access to the first and second floors, providing ease of living and security for all residents.\nThe development is ideally positioned on the western edge of Newton Mearns, just a short walk from The Avenue Shopping Centre and Parklands Health Club. With excellent transport links via the M77, Stewart Gardens offers effortless connectivity to Glasgow city centre, the Ayrshire coast and beyond.\nResidents can enjoy the best of both worlds – the vibrancy of city life and the tranquillity of open green spaces, with beautifully maintained communal gardens with pergola, seating and ample planting, creating a serene retreat from urban hustle and bustle.\nAmong the available homes are the last remaining three and four bedroom top-floor duplex apartments, offering an elevated standard of luxury living. The standout among these is the Argyll, a four bedroom duplex spanning 1,735 sq ft and offering panoramic views of Glasgow’s south side from its private Velux balconies.\nFrom the moment you step into the Argyll duplex, the sense of space and luxury is undeniable. The expansive hallway leads to a stylish open-plan lounge and kitchen, complete with fully integrated appliances and a generous dining area. French doors open onto a private balcony, allowing natural light to flood the living space while providing a perfect outdoor nook for relaxation. The lower floor hosts two large bedrooms, with the master bedroom featuring fitted wardrobes and private access to the bathroom.\nUpstairs, the second level offers two additional bedrooms with charming coombe ceilings and Velux windows that transform into balcony areas, inviting in fresh air and natural light. A separate shower room on the upper floor ensures convenience and privacy for the entire household. As the last available apartment of its kind in Stewart Gardens, this exquisite home is priced at £484,500.\nRegional Sales Director, Liz Cleghorn said: “The apartments at Stewart Gardens offer a unique combination of space, style, and functionality, making them an ideal choice for a wide range of buyers. Whether you're a young couple looking for a modern city escape, a family in need of more room to grow, or someone looking to downsize without sacrificing quality. These homes truly cater to everyone and we’re really happy to hear Pauline and Marc are delighted with their new home.\n“Each apartment is designed with the highest standards in mind. The open-plan living spaces create a sense of light and airiness, while the large bedrooms offer the perfect retreat. With high-quality fixtures, integrated kitchen appliances, and custom-fitted wardrobes, no detail has been overlooked.\n“We have been building homes in Newton Mearns for many years, and Stewart Gardens has truly exceeded expectations. With its location, outstanding design, and family-friendly features, it’s clear why these apartments are in such high demand. We encourage anyone considering a new home to visit us and experience the incredible quality for themselves – it’s not something you can truly appreciate from pictures alone.”\nPrices at Stewart Gardens start from £346,500. The sales office is open Thursday to Monday, 10am – 4pm.

      "content_en": "The Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre (IBioIC) is responsible for managing the cluster in Scotland, working in partnership with Scottish Enterprise and Forth Valley College to support the cohort. Since 2014, IBioIC has helped to attract £35m in research and development funding for its 300 members.\n“Scotland has a thriving bioeconomy, and we’re pleased to see this latest commitment from the Innovate UK Launchpad programme to support new projects that will contribute to a greener future,\" said Liz Fletcher, director of business engagement at IBioIC.\n\"Bio-based manufacturing is key to achieving net zero targets and there are many possibilities for alternatives to fossil fuels emerging, backed by research and development. However, SMEs in this space face many challenges and to address these we are developing a range of activities as part of our role as the Launchpad cluster manager to support each participant to achieve their goals.”\nThe first stage of Launchpad in Scotland saw around £1.8m allocated to 13 projects and businesses focusing on the development of green fuels, polymers, and alternative foods, among other specialisms. Among these was SilviBio which received an award of £88,000 to further development of its peat-free plant propagation blocks for vegetable growers.\nIBioIC recently appointed Kirsty Neilson as its new programme manager to support the projects involved in each stage of the Launchpad initiative. She previously held the role of product development manager at Marine Biopolymers, a company extracting high-value components from brown seaweeds for use in a range of applications such as pharmaceuticals.\n“Being part of a start-up for over a decade means that, in some ways, I have already experienced and overcome many of the challenges that the Launchpad cohort may face, and I will be able to support them to navigate their next chapter of growth,\" Ms Neilson said.\n\"There are so many different sectors that come under the umbrella of industrial biotechnology, which makes it incredibly diverse and interesting. The Launchpad projects, in particular, could lead to significant growth and potential green jobs for Scotland in the future.”\nCharity launches free holidays for disadvantaged children\nMargo Paterson, chief executive of Hostelling Scotland (Image: Hostelling Scotland) A Scottish holiday organisation that runs youth hostels across Scotland is launching an initiative to provide free stays for disadvantaged young people and families, with applications set to open today.\nHostelling Scotland, a registered charity with 29 youth hostels and 24 affiliate hostels across the country, has created Happy Hosteller Breaks as part of its \"longstanding commitment to supporting young people and communities\".\nRead the full story here.\nScotland dismisses the self-employed at its own peril\nMore young people than ever say they would like to work for themselves (Image: NQ Archive)\nThe 250,000 self-employed people in Scotland contribute almost £15 billion annually to the country's economy and there are plenty of way Chancellor Rachel Reeves could make self-employment more attractive in Spring Statement later this week, argues Colin Borland of the Federation of Small Businesses.\nRead the full story here.",

And what would you say that hourly rate is?\"\nRead More on social care in Scotland:\nThe answer is £12 per hour, rising to £12.60 this year.\nNew figures published by The Herald revealed that workers in residential care are paid 27% less than the average UK worker, and their hourly pay is now below that of their counterparts in the rest of the country.\nOver 40,000 people in Scotland live in care homes, a figure which is only going to rise due to the ageing population, but low wages are fuelling a recruitment and retention crisis in the vital sector.\nKenny says: \"I started nine years ago and I think there are only four of us left. I’d say we have two-thirds of staff turnover every two years, it’s constant recruitment.\n“You’re in competition with other living wage employers who require less of their staff in terms of skills.\n\"All of the local fast food restaurants in our area pay more than we get paid. All of the supermarkets in our area pay more than we get paid – in fact, I struggle to name any employer in my area that pays less than what we get per hour.\n\"Even people who are passionate about the job, people who love the job and got into the job to genuinely help people who require it, don’t stay.\nSocial are is facing a retention crisis\n“Even if you love the job you have to pay the bills, and people leave – and that’s just the people who love the job.\n“This is a hard job with a lot of responsibility – why would people want that responsibility when they get nip next door to a retail job and be paid more?\n\"Our job is not a lowest amount job, you can’t attract people to a highly-skilled job by paying those rates and you can’t help the people we’re meant to help by paying those rates.\n“The Scottish Government know that, they’ve made a choice to put the money elsewhere. They may say otherwise but they’ve chosen to keep our wages at that rate..\n“The people we support and ourselves are hidden away in your community, we’re the quiet people who get on with their jobs.\n“We’re not the NHS angels, we’re not given this glorified status – which I believe the NHS deserve, by the way - because we’re in the private and charity sector we’re hidden away.\n“If it wasn’t for us being there quietly in the communities that we help, a lot of people would suffer.”\nThe high levels of staff turnover can also have a detrimental effect on residents.\nKenny says: \"With a lot of the people we support trust is a big issue, and personal interaction is a big issue.\n“For the people we support trust can take years to develop, and I don’t exaggerate that. They'll get used to one member of staff and then they're suddenly gone.\n\"Can you imagine your primary caregiver being changed on you every two months, and how that would affect you? If you had to get to know a new primary caregiver every two months?\n“It’s a vicious circle, because quite often when the people we support don’t get a balanced environment the way they respond to new people becomes what some may see as challenging.\n“If they had a stable long-term environment it would be easier for the new staff, but because it’s so constant it’s emotionally draining for both the people we support and the new staff coming in.\n“So, for the new recruits the job is harder than it should be.\n\"All the companies I’m aware of spend masses of money on agency, and I believe the NHS is the same. Ultimately they’ve got to provide somebody, but someone from an agency might come in to support someone for a day and then go away again.\n“I’ve just talked about the turmoil it can cause when people come in and they’re only there for a couple of months, so imagine what it’s like when agency staff come in for a day?”",

      "content_en": "Today most of the late wave bands are far from the zeitgeist, the likes of Razorlight, The Kooks and The Enemy playing their successful albums in full on the nostalgia circuit.\nOne might have expected The Wombats to follow a similar trajectory.\nFirst single 'Moving to New York', which went top 20 in 2006, shot the Liverpool group to fame and they followed it up with 'Kill the Director' and the platinum-selling 'Let's Dance to Joy Division'.\nRead More:\nAnyone not paying attention may have assumed their mainstream career ended there, but the trio are bigger than they've ever been.\nThey're in the midst of their first ever arena tour and, unlike The Courteeners or The View you won't find their gigs populated by beery blokes in their 30s.\nAs anyone who witnessed the throng of adoring teenagers who made it impossible to get near the stage for their 2023 TRNSMT set can attest, The Wombats are, whisper it, cool.\nDrummer Dan Haggis tells The Herald: \"I remember that gig because Lewis Capaldi came to our dressing room after and had a chat and he was so sweet.\n\"For us, obviously, we never went anywhere, we kind of just kept touring album after album.\n\"We're really lucky that each album we've done, we've kind of had enough support from radio or Spotify playlists or whatever that we have kept some new fans coming.\n\"But the big one for us was when there was a remix of 'Greek Tragedy', which we hadn't even heard, that suddenly started going viral on TikTok.\n\"We didn't even know what TikTok was when we first heard about this but I guess there were loads of young people on there who heard it then went and discovered the band.\nThe Wombats (Image: Newsquest)\n\"But also one thing I've noticed from speaking to fans is that we we get a lot of people who come who might be like 16, 18 or whatever, and they'll say, 'oh, I started listening to you guys when I was seven because my dad played it to us' or, you know, their older brother or whatever it is.\n\"It's so amazing to hear those stories. We get a pretty diverse range of crowds, to be honest.\"\nThe Wombats have very much built and maintained their following on the back of their albums and live shows.\nThe group hasn't had a top 100 charting single since 2011 but their last five albums have gone top five, with 2022's Fix Yourself, Not the World going to number one.\nMr Haggis says: \"We love playing live so much. That's where we started and like where we will end, that's where it all kind of comes together and makes sense.\n\"I think like the crowds over the years just feed off that and we feed off them, it's always just like a pretty joyous, rowdy occasion.\n\"Getting a number one album was a little surprising, but lovely.\n\"It's kind of arbitrary getting a number one because if you'd have released it a week later with the same amount of sales, it could have been number three and it wouldn't have made any difference to what the actual album was and how people individually feel about it.\n\"So for us, it's not the be all and end all. But it is definitely a good sign that there are people out there who love guitar music and I don't think it ever really goes away.\n\"We're lucky that we've got like a little army of Wombats fans who get out there and support us and hopefully, you know, if there are younger bands out there grabbing a guitar and a bass and drums the good thing with having a charting album is that then they go, 'oh, see, there are bands that are playing guitars that still doing well'.\"\nTestament to their unprecedented popularity, The Wombats will headline Glasgow's Hydro on March 25 - the biggest show they've ever played in the city.\nThe drummer says: \"We've always been so spoiled by Scottish crowds in general and Glasgow always has been one of the rowdiest most fun places ever since we first drove up there ourselves to King Tut's to support The Dykeenies in, I think, 2005.\n\"It was just like such a warm welcome, similar to Liverpool, just really warm, friendly people and also music lovers - it runs deep, doesn't it?\n\"To go from King Tut's all the way back then to like playing an arena is going to be a pinch yourself moment for sure and we can't wait.\n\"This tour is the first arena tour we've done. We've done we have done the O2 before, we've done Leeds Arena and certain arenas over the years but never in one go.\n\"But for us in all honesty playing the Barrowlands is such an insane experience.\n\"I'm sure playing an arena will still be great - it's just going to be a slightly bigger version of doing a Barrowlands show.\n\"We played the O2 Arena last album round and one of the things that we heard from people was, 'oh, even though it's such a big venue, it felt very intimate.\n\"Maybe it's because we come from that world that we still we want it to feel as intimate as possible, it just means there's more people singing along than there would be at a smaller show, really.\"",

Care workers are vulnerable because they care about what they do, that’s why they work for the money they do.\n“They aren’t there for the money, it’s because they care about what they’re doing. And I think care homes exploit that.”",

      "content_en": "Starmer has defended the cuts as necessary to combat “devastating” increases in the sickness and benefits disability bill, which is estimated to rise to £70 billion a year by 2030.\nIn Scotland, where welfare funding is devolved, a proportionate cut to the Treasury block grant would take place, similar to what happened when winter fuel payments were axed last autumn.\nSpeakers addressed the crowd from the Royal Concert Hall steps. (Image: Josh Pizzuto-Pomaco) Tressa Burke is the CEO of Glasgow Disability Alliance. She says the cuts do not reflect the “dignity and respect” disabled people deserve.\n“When times get tough, the government gets tough on disabled people”, Burke says.\n“The government is supposed to be helping people get access to work. This will not do that, but it will put people into poverty. Where is the dignity and the respect that disabled people deserve?\n\"Disabled people live with deep and long term inequality. A recent survey we conducted of disabled people living in Glasgow found that 79% are not able to access services, 91% deal with social isolation, and 71% can’t pay their bills.\"\nBurke added: “Disabled people are feeling afraid and are being scapegoated for the country’s debt. Instead of these cuts, we would appreciate more investment in social security and wider public services.”\nSeveral dozen disabled people, careers, and activists gathered at the top of Buchanan Street on Thursday evening to protest the cuts.\nAhead of the rally, the organiser, Euan Mitchell of Disabled People Against Cuts Glasgow, told The Herald he couldn’t stand by and not speak out.\nEuan Mitchell helped to organise the protest. (Image: Josh Pizzuto-Pomaco) “These cuts to disability services and to disabled people’s benefits are some of the most horrendous I've ever seen”, said Mitchell, a disabled person who also cares for a family member.\n“These are further attacks to the finances of people who are already taking on a large burden. People are already on their knees and this is just going to make it worse.\n“We’re getting to a situation where disabled people are going to become a hidden group in society. No amount of attacks on society’s poorest and most vulnerable people are going to fix the financial issue that has been created. We don’t keep disabled people safe by cutting their money.\"\nMitchell compared the current situation to the first wave of austerity instituted by the Tories in 2010.\nHe said: “Back then, the number of disabled people who died was horrendous, some through starvation, others from taking their own lives. Similarly, this just feels like the government is kicking a group when they’re already down.\n“There’s a lot of fear, but one of the things which can combat fear is people thinking they can make a difference and come together and realise they’re not alone.”\nFiona Robertson is a writer and disability activist from Aberdeen.\nShe told The Herald: “I can't really describe the despair in the disability community right now. We've spent fourteen years being the target of repeated, brutal austerity cuts which caused so much suffering and death, and most people had believed a Labour government would be the end to that, and we'd finally get the support we need to live our lives.\n“But the 'hard decisions' are never about making themselves unpopular with big donors, and are always about making life harder for sick and poor people.”\nFiona Robertson is a writer and disability activist (Image: Josh Pizzuto-Pomaco) Robertson added: “Using standard stigma about disabled people who can't work to target PIP is calculated and cruel, as it is not a work-replacement benefit. But even with the push to 'get disabled people into work' - the problem does not lie with us. We don't need CV help and confidence building.\n“Yes, many disabled people could do some work, but that might be four hours a week, at unpredictable times because of the variability of their condition. Many will need to work from home to avoid exacerbating their conditions.\n“If you want more disabled people in work, the only way to do that is to incentivise employers to be more inclusive, not to torture disabled people by withdrawing support we need to survive to try to get us into jobs which don't exist.”\nScottish Labour stalwart and former MSP Neil Findlay left the party in protest last week over the plans.\nIn a letter to Keir Starmer, Findlay wrote: “As political leaders like you, Mr Starmer, and your colleague Wes Streeting seek to stigmatise those with a mental illness and take money from those suffering from cancer, multiple sclerosis or heart disease, you accept hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of freebies; financial donations, clothing, glasses and tickets to football matches and pop concerts.\n“Tell me who is really milking the system? Of course it's one rule for you and another rule for the poor, the sick and disabled.\"",

This would apply regardless of whether the dog was working at the time it was stolen.\nIt would also seek to amend the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 to classify dog theft as a prescribed offence, allowing those who have had their dogs taken to submit a victim impact statement in any court, summary or solemn, about how the theft affected them emotionally, physically, or psychologically.\nCurrently, statements can only be made by victims and family members of victims in solemn cases, those dealing with the most serious crimes, including murder, rape, abduction, some assaults, housebreaking and some crimes of violence.\nThat could mean someone whose dog was stolen could make a statement in a case that wasn’t heard by a jury but only by a Sheriff, while a victim of assault being dealt with in a summary court would not.\nIn the high court, someone whose dog has been stolen could make a statement, but someone who is the victim of human trafficking or domestic abuse would not be able to do so.\nCOPFS warns that there are “practical and resource implications of the extension of the scheme to cover the theft of a dog.”\nThey state: “It is respectfully suggested the draft provisions create an anomaly within the criminal justice system whereby a victim impact statement can be given for theft of dog when it is not open to victims to provide such a statement in many other scenarios including for charges in the solemn courts.\n“In addition, the introduction and expansion of this scheme to include all offences relating to the theft of a dog would have financial consequences and time constraints.”\nThey argued that information about the emotional impact can already be made available to the court through evidence or narrative.\nThey also point out that Scottish Ministers already have the power to modify the list of prescribed offences without the need for primary legislation.\nIn their submission, they also pointed out that the proposed penalties are no different from the sentencing disposals already available, and that existing common law already covers the theft of any pet, not just dogs.\nMaurice Goden with spaniel (Image: PA)Mr Golden’s Bill has cross-party support in Holyrood, with all of the Tory MSPs backing the legislation as well as MSPs from the SNP, Labour, Lib Dems and Greens.\nOffering their support for the new offence, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association said the law failed “to recognise the deep emotional bond between dogs and their owners, meaning sentences are often disproportionately lenient.\"\nThey added: \"For guide dog owners, theft will have life-changing consequences... If a dog were stolen, the loss would be far more abrupt and damaging, leaving the handler without vital support for mobility and independence.\"\n\"The inclusion of an aggravation for the theft of an assistance dog is essential to ensuring that the justice system recognises the severe impact of such a crime.\"\nThey argued that “no alternative approaches to addressing dog theft would be as effective, enforceable, or comprehensive as introducing a standalone offence.\"\nREAD MORE\nThe Dogs Trust argues that standalone legislation “would be a positive step in recognising dogs as sentient and to truly take into account the welfare impact on both the stolen dog and their owner.\"\nThe Law Society of Scotland take a “neutral view” on the creation of a new offence, though they “consider that the sentencing process already recognises the emotional harm that dog abductions may produce in victims, in the scope of the common law offence of theft.\"\n\"If more resources are not provided to criminal justice institutions, the creation of new offences will have a very limited impact in increasing the number of people convicted,” they add\nThe committee is set to take evidence from the COPFS, Police Scotland and the charities on Wednesday.",

      "content_en": "Hostelling Scotland, a registered charity with 29 youth hostels and 24 affiliate hostels across the country, has created Happy Hosteller Breaks as part of its \"longstanding commitment to supporting young people and communities\".\nThe launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of Covid-19, which stymied the charity’s income and consequently restricted its youth action work.\nThis marks the revival of its flagship residential programme, and comes after Hostelling Scotland funded more than 200 residential trips over the past decade, helping at least 6,000 people access unforgettable experiences.\nThe new initiative resumes this activity, supported by membership contributions and donations, and aimed at organisations such as schools, early years centres, registered charities in Scotland working with disadvantaged young people and families, and other youth groups\nHere, Margo Paterson, chief executive of Hostelling Scotland, outlines what drives the organisation.\nWhat is your organisation called?\nOur official name is Scottish Youth Hostels Association, a not-for-profit charity established in 1931 with a mission to inspire all – especially young people – to explore and experience Scotland. However, the lifestyles and expectations of modern travellers are ever-changing, and to reflect this, we rebranded as Hostelling Scotland in 2017. This fresh identity better resonates with a new generation of hostellers while still embracing the strong community values at the heart of our organisation.\nWhere is it based?\nOur head office is in Stirling, but our reach extends far beyond. We operate 29 hostels across Scotland, spanning diverse and unique locations. From the vibrant streets of Leith Walk in Edinburgh to the pristine sands of Achmelvich Beach on the North Coast 500, from Port Charlotte on Islay to our remote eco-hostel at Loch Ossian, our network showcases the very best of Scotland’s landscapes and culture.\nWhat does it do?\nAt its core, Hostelling Scotland provides safe, affordable, and welcoming accommodation for those keen to explore Scotland, whether solo travellers, families, school groups, or international visitors. More than just a place to stay, we foster a sense of community and inclusivity, ensuring guests from all cultures and backgrounds feel at home.\nREAD MORE:\nAs a charitable organisation, we are committed to removing barriers to travel. Our youth programmes and partnerships, such as Shared Care Scotland’s Respitality Programme, provide invaluable opportunities for young people and families who might not otherwise have the chance to experience a holiday. Hostelling is about adventure, connection, and accessibility, and we strive to make that possible for as many people as we can.\nWho are your customers?\nWe welcome everyone, with a special focus on young people. Our doors are open to individual travellers, families, school and youth groups, as well as domestic and international visitors seeking an authentic Scottish experience. In 2024, we hosted 332,977 overnights, a testament to the continued appeal of hostelling in Scotland.\nHow many people do you employ?\nWith a seasonal operating model, our workforce fluctuates throughout the year. At peak season we have a team of 200 dedicated employees, many of whom return year after year, drawn by their passion for hospitality and Scotland’s great outdoors.\nWhy did you take the plunge, and what were you doing before?\nI had already been part of Hostelling Scotland as Deputy CEO and felt a deep connection to the organisation’s mission. When the opportunity arose to lead as CEO, it was a natural step. Having dedicated almost 24 years to the organisation, I remain as passionate as ever about evolving the hostelling experience and expanding our reach, particularly for young people and families. With our 100th anniversary in 2031 on the horizon, I feel privileged to be steering the organisation towards an exciting future.\nWhat do you least enjoy?\nI love the variety of my role – visiting our hostels, connecting with teams, planning for the future, and learning from international colleagues. However, like many in leadership, I sometimes wish there were more hours in the day! We have so many ambitions, but funding constraints can limit how quickly we can realise them. That can be frustrating, but it also makes every achievement all the more rewarding.\nWhat are your ambitions for Hostelling Scotland?\nTo cement our place as Scotland’s leading hostelling organisation and ensure that more young people, families, and groups experience the joy, adventure, and community spirit of hostelling.\nREAD MORE:\nWe want to modernise our hostels, continue enhancing our sustainability efforts, and broaden access to travel through our youth and community programmes.\nWhat would most help you achieve this?\nIncreased funding and investment would allow us to expand and enhance our hostel network, making it even more accessible and appealing. More importantly, it would allow us to reach more young people and families who would benefit from travel, outdoor experiences, and cultural exploration.\nWhat is the most valuable lesson you have learned?\nIt all comes down to people. Hostelling is far more than buildings and beds – it’s about the experiences, connections, and warmth that our team brings to every guest. Our success is built on the dedication of our staff, volunteers, and supporters, and by continuously listening to our guests, we can evolve to meet their needs and exceed their expectations.\nWhat has been your best moment as CEO?\nThere have been so many. But what always makes me proud is seeing the direct impact of our work – whether it’s a young person experiencing their first trip to Scotland’s Highlands, a family enjoying a well-earned break, or international travellers forming lifelong friendships in our hostels. Watching people discover Scotland through hostelling is an incredibly rewarding experience.\nAnd the worst?\nWithout a doubt, having to close our network during the COVID-19 pandemic. The uncertainty, the impact on our staff and communities, and the loss of opportunities for so many travellers and young people were incredibly difficult to navigate. However, we emerged stronger, more resilient, and even more committed to our mission.\nHow do you relax?\nTime with family and friends is essential for me, and I make sure to prioritise exercise –whether that’s in the gym or out in Scotland’s great outdoors. Staying active helps me clear my mind and stay focused on the road ahead.",

What’s really exciting this year is that we get to celebrate female entrepreneurship as part of the programme of events.\n“How many people know that the tearoom was invented by a Glasgow woman?”\nOliver Braid, National Trust for Scotland’s creative learning manager at Mackintosh at the Willow, said: “The Scottish tearoom phenomenon of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is increasingly recognised for its cultural and culinary significance, shaping Scotland’s food, drink, and social histories of gender, race and class.”\nThe programme includes a talk by writer Perilla Kinchin on the history of Kate Cranston’s tea rooms, as well as historical talks on tea smuggling, the dark history of sugar as a product of Caribbean slavery, and how sugar became part of Scotland’s national identity.\nIt also features a session on the “creative confections” inspired by the rise of afternoon tea, such as shortbread and the empire biscuit, and the recipes that defined Scottish tea-taking rituals.",

      "content_en": "The Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland (CTUS), an independent foundation offering grants to support access to higher education, commissioned a poll on Scotland's “value, accessibility and funding of higher education” in Scotland.\nConducted by Ipsos Public Affairs, the poll showed widespread support for some form of Scottish Government-funded tuition. However, there was significant variation on how that should be implemented and who should be targeted for support.\nAlmost half (48%) of participants supported charging university tuition fees based on ability to pay, particularly if government funding was focused on those with lower household incomes, those who face historical barriers to entry, or those studying courses where there are skills shortages, such as nurses or engineers.\nLess than one-third (29%) directly opposed the idea.\nGeneral support for change but division on the direction\nScottish universities charge tuition fees for undergraduate degrees, with limits set by the Scottish and UK Governments. How much each student pays depends on their chosen university, where they live, whether or not they have previously attended university, and whether they are studying full-time or part-time.\nThe Scottish Government covers all tuition fees for full-time students living in Scotland and attending a Scottish university for their first undergraduate degree. The government's per student rate is dependent on the subject of study, and includes a standard £1,820 fee per student.\nThe government only covers tuition for part-time Scottish students if their household income is below £25,000.\nNon-Scottish students pay tuition fees at different rates, depending on whether they live in the UK. Students from the rest of the UK pay a set rate of £9,535 per year, while fees for international students are much higher, depending on the course and at the discretion of each university. Some range as high as £50,000 per year.\nParticipants were divided on whether the Scottish Government should cover the costs for all first-time undergraduate students living in Scotland (44%) or focus on low-income students while those whose households can afford it pay at least some of the cost of tuition (43%).\nFully government-funded tuition for all first-time undergraduates was most popular among those living in higher-income households of over £100,000 annually, those with children at home, younger age groups, and those who attended university.\nThe poll also asked participants to consider potential options for changing the tuition model in Scotland.\nThe most popular option was charging tuition fees based on ability to pay (48%). Under this system, students from lower-income households would pay low or no fees, and students from higher-income households would pay more.\nOpinions on this strategy differed depending on participants' household incomes. Charging tuition to those more able to pay was generally less popular among higher income brackets.\nRequiring employers to pay some contribution to the cost of university education was the second most popular option (39%).\nAnother favoured option was to charge tuition fees to all undergraduate students living in Scotland, with loans available that would only start being paid back once graduates began earning above a certain income level (35%). Many respondents, however, were opposed to this (43%).\nThe idea of a graduate tax, which would require all university graduates to pay a higher income tax once they earn above a certain level, was the least popular option (26% supported) and had the most direct opposition (48% opposed).\nParticipants were also asked what level of annual tuition fee they thought was reasonable to charge an undergraduate for a four-year degree. Opinion was relatively evenly split on fees up to £5,000 per year.\nThe most popular annual fee rate was between £3,000 and £4,999 (22%), followed by £1,500-£2,999 (21%) and less than £1,500 (20%).\nTargeted tuition support a popular strategy\nIf the government were to begin offering targeted tuition support, nearly two-thirds participants said low-income students should be the highest priority, followed by students studying courses where there are skill shortages, such as nursing (59%), and then students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nParticipants also clearly supported government funding to prioritise apprenticeships, grants for disadvantaged students, and upskilling for existing workers.\nRead more\nIn response to the poll results, CTUS announced it was commissioning a Citizen Jury to assemble a representative sample of Scots to investigate the higher education funding and make recommendations.\nHannah Garrow, Chief Executive of the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, said the question of funding is “complex” and has long-ranging consequences for families and society.\n”However, recent discussions on how to finance higher education feel like they are stuck on repeat, while, for many people, funding continues to be seen as a barrier to access\".\n“This research shows that there is room for a more nuanced and open discussion on priorities for funding. If politicians are struggling to come up with solutions, perhaps the public can inject some democratic innovation into the debate.\n\"The government has already committed to lead the development of a new funding model so understanding the views of the public as beneficiaries and users of the system is critical.\n“We hope that the Scottish Government and all political parties in Scotland will get behind our Citizen Jury and commit to giving its outcomes careful consideration.\"\nPoll comes as universities face funding uncertainty\nThe publication of the Ipsos and CTUS poll comes only days after new data showed a sharp decline in the number of fee-paying international students at Scottish universities, a key source of income for many institutions.\nMultiple universities are facing financial challenges, with an estimated eight of 18 expected to report deficits when the newest sector analysis is released. Most recently, the University of Dundee announced a deficit and controversial draft recovery plan that includes cuts to 632 jobs, but other universities, including the University of Edinburgh—which has forecast a £140 million deficit over 18 months—are also looking to close gaps in their budget.\nThe Scottish Government has remained committed to providing free tuition for Scottish students, but university leaders are increasingly calling for a nuanced conversation about the amount of funding that the government provides.",

Everyone should have the right to breathe clean air.”",

      "content_en": "“After finishing my degree I just didn’t have the belief I could become a full-time artist. I thought it was unachievable. One of my lecturers saw the potential in me at the time, but I just didn't have confidence in myself I guess,” she reflects.\n“I went into teaching because I love working with kids and spent four years in schools, but I was basically trying to juggle two full-time jobs. It wore me down, working at night after a full day at school and every weekend. Full-time and full-time is double-time, I guess! I got to a point where I thought, ‘I don’t want this to just be a side hustle’ and decided it was time to take the leap. If I can do it, I can do it. If I can’t, I can’t. There’s only one way to find out.”\nThe Ayrshire-born artist concedes it’s not been a linear journey since making the call last year and credits Outerspaces, Morphe Arts and the Glasgow Creative Network as support mechanisms in what can prove a lonely world for creatives. However, the quality of her work is presenting opportunities and advancement - including the launch of a third independent show next month.\nTeacher turned artist, Dawn Spence (Image: Maria Reingolt Photography )\nThe Glasgow-based painter, who names Yayoi Kusama and Shawn Huckins as influences, will present at the Alchemy Experiment in the West End next month during an exhibition running from April 4-11. Opening night on the Friday lasts from 7-9 and there’s an artist's talk the following Wednesday, offering an opportunity to hear the story behind the project. The launch evening is a celebration with drinks, friends and family all expected, presenting Spence a chance to share the creative process with her biggest supporters.\n“I want my exhibitions to be a chance for people to chat to me as an artist, because, I don’t want to be a hidden artist,” she smiles. Recently Spence was featured at Green Gallery and Lemond Gallery. Before the end of the year there are trips to MUST wine in London and the Pittenweem Arts festival.\nIt was during a week in Florence last year, is a city known for a painting or two, that Spence encountered the inspiration for her latest show titled ‘Freedom’.\nRead more Herald arts:\nInvesting in an oil painting course to acquire skills not taught in her local studies with the funds earned from previous exhibitions, sessions learning the techniques of classics like Sandro Botticelli provided ideas and inspiration for her next series of work.\n“I called this exhibition ‘Freedom’ because I was really interested in fabric folds, transparent fabrics and how they, for want of a better phrase, whisper in the wind. It reminds me of a wedding day - throwing the veil over a sunset and revealing something previously unseen.\n“I want people to see my work and feel really uplifted and joyful. It’s not about people coming in and feeling under pressure to understand my art, but just appreciate it.”\nSpence’s work is immersing and combines contemporary, abstract, surrealist and landscape themes. It’s hard to fit into a box, she admits. Perhaps that is why her work stands out and leaves so clear an impression on untrained eyes like this correspondent’s.\nDawn Spence: It’s so important to understand the time, effort and inspiration of creating a work (Image: Maria Reingolt Photography )\n“I guess I’m not just painting typical landscapes, the style I’ve developed over time fits with my desire for people to see new perspectives. Seeing something heavenly, something really warm and inviting. Even if those coming to my show don't like art, or they don't see the value in it, hopefully they step away going, ‘I've never seen that before’.”\nSpeance’s style “repeats strokes” to connote vibrancy and pulsations. “For me, it's almost a therapeutic way of looking at something.”\nAnd art, in all its forms, has never been more important, has it? As our algorithms tell us AI will replace every hard-honed skill by tomorrow and everything appears on demand at the touch of a screen, there is a strength in the creatives who value process and a human touch that can never quite be manufactured or cloned.\n“Especially with AI impacting art, people maybe think, ‘How easy it is to create that’? But it’s so important to understand the time, effort and inspiration of creating a work,” adds Spence. “It’s about what the artist has done to get to that moment and it’s the story behind reaching that point too, isn’t it?”\nFor Spence, it’s the story that makes this exhibition extra special, inviting others into her own journey by sharing new perspectives.\nFind out more about 'Freedom' by Dawn Spence at The alchemy experiment",

It is a muddy harbour and, as it stands, it doesn’t add anything to the town.\n\"It will make a massive difference when the redevelopment is complete. The area will be transformed into a bright and beautiful environment for the local community as well as a boost for visitors to Annan.\"\nHow the harbour might look The Annan project is considered unusual in terms of the scale and cost for a community-run project.\nMr Thomson said: \"It is big and it is ambitious. ‘And it’s possibly the biggest community-owned redevelopment in Scotland.\n\"It is also unusual in that it is a community-run project which has accessed Levelling-Up funds. Levelling-Up funding tends to be accessed via councils and we are one of the few community groups who got funds that way.\n\"The community in Annan is champing at the bit to get the plan underway and we very much work on the wishes of the community.\"\nBuilding work on the Annan Harbour project is expected to start towards the end of the year and is due to be completed in about three years time.\n\"Having the project team in place will give the development a real boost.

Her words of courage will be heard across the UK before participants set off on the Race for Life routes.\nAfter successful treatment including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Laura who is in remission, was guest of honour at her home Race for Life event in Glasgow last year. She also ran Race for Life Glasgow 10K alongside her husband Brian Eggo who has been a constant support to every step of the way through the disease. They were both cheered on from the sidelines by their five-year old daughter Ivy. Brian also took part in memory of his brother Alasdair who died from lung cancer aged 51 in December 2023. Together the family and friends raised more than £2,745 for Cancer Research UK.\nLaura and her daughter Ivy (Image: LESLEY MARTIN)\nIn February last year, it was discovered that Laura has inherited the faulty BRCA1 gene. She now faces more surgery to cut the risk of cancer returning.\nLaura, now 43, of East Kilbride said: “We all have a reason to Race for Life. “For me it’s a chance to say thank you, to raise money to help people tackling cancer right now. Finding out I have the faulty BRCA1 gene was a shock. I will be looking at more surgery in the future but that news has made me even more determined to do what I can to support the discovery of more treatments and cures for my daughter’s generation.” Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life, in partnership with headline sponsor Standard Life, part of Phoenix Group, is an inspiring series of 3k, 5k, 10k, Pretty Muddy and Pretty Muddy Kids events which raise millions of pounds every year to help beat cancer by funding crucial research. Lisa Adams, Cancer Research UK’s spokesperson in Scotland, said: “No matter how cancer affects us, life is worth racing for. “Sadly nearly 1 in 2 of us will get cancer in our lifetime* but all of us can support the research that will beat it. We’re proud that Race for Life has had such a positive impact. Every pound raised supports our life-saving work, which has helped double cancer survival in the UK over the last 50 years. “We’d love for as many people as possible across Glasgow and other parts of Scotland to join us at Race for Life. There is an event for everyone and we mean everyone. Our events are strictly noncompetitive which means everyone can have a go- and love every minute. There’s no pressure to finish in a certain time, just give it what you can. Lace up and join in.” Since it began in 1994, more than 10 million people have taken part in Race for Life, contributing millions of pounds towards life-saving research. Cancer Research UK funded scientists led the development of the Human Papillomavirus Virus vaccine, which is expected to prevent almost 90 per cent of cervical cancers in the UK. The charity were a key player in the development of radiotherapy which now benefits millions of cancer patients worldwide. Cancer Research UK played a leading role in the development of abiraterone - a drug that gives men with advanced prostate cancer more time with their friends and family.\nJoin your local 3k, 5k, 10k or Pretty Muddy® events\nGlasgow Green 18/5/25\nStrathclyde Country Parlk 14/6/25\nJoin now at raceforlife.org",

      "content_en": "It is one of ten early Byrne works which were bought from him by his local parish priest, Father Tom Jamieson in Renfrew, Renfrewshire, in the early 1970s.\nThe artwork was created as a study for a larger painting and is estimated at £10,000 to £15,000.\nThe 10 works will be sold by auction house Lyon & Turnbull live and online on April 2.\nREAD MORE:\nJohn Byrne — Life and times of the slab boy outsider\nJohn Byrne obituary: Artist leaves 'outstanding' legacy\nJohn Byrne on art, faith, fatherhood ... and mortality\nByrne became friends with Father Jamieson when the artist and his family lived on Paisley Road, Renfrew, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, bonding over a shared love of music and culture.\nThe priest bought work from Byrne, who worked from his studio garage in the back garden.\nByrne’s daughter Celie Byrne, also an artist, spoke of Father Jamieson and George Harrison visiting their house while she and her brother were small.\nIn an interview filmed for Lyon & Turnbull’s social media platforms, she said: “I remember Father Jamieson from when I was tiny. He would come round to the house quite regularly.\n“They would sit and talk about work, and he went out to the garage looking at my dad’s artwork and what he was working on.\nEach of The Beatles is pictured with a spirit animal (Image: Stewart Attwood/PA)\n“I just remember him being really lovely and I always remember his stripy scarf.”\nShe added: “We were wee obviously but apparently George Harrison came to the house twice in Renfrew for dinner.”\nThe sale also features a piece commissioned by Scottish folk musician Donovan in 1971 for the cover of HMS Donovan, an album of children’s songs.\nThe original oil painting for this is estimated at between £6,000 and £8,000.\nAll works in the collection of Father Tom Jamieson were produced during Byrne’s “Patrick” era, during which the Glasgow School of Art graduate signed the majority of his work with his father’s first name and pretended to be a “primitive” self-taught artist to attract the interest of the London art world.\nPaisley-born Byrne, creator of TV show Tutti Frutti and the play The Slab Boys, died on November 30, 2023 aged 83.\nJohn Byrne was renowned as an artist and playwright\nOther works in the sale include the large painting Homage a Hockney, 1970, which is expected to fetch between £20,000 and £30,000.\nIt was created to coincide with David Hockney’s major retrospective exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, in 1969-1970.\nAnother monumental work is Untitled (Musician), c. 1973-1975, also with an estimate of £20,000 to £30,000.\nCharlotte Riordan, Lyon & Turnbull’s head of contemporary & post-war art, said: “This is an amazing collection of John Byrne’s work. Father Jamieson clearly had a keen eye for artistic talent, seeing great promise in a man who would go on to make his own distinctive and indelible mark on Scottish, and indeed British, cultural life.\n“The Beatles painting was a precursor to a larger version, created for his 1969 December show at London’s Portal Gallery.\n“This was a reference and reaction to the fact that Portal attracted a star-studded clientele, with some of the biggest names in British showbusiness at the time becoming frequent visitors. Clients included; Julie Christie, Michael Caine, David Niven, David Bailey, The Beatles – particularly Ringo Starr who is thought to own ‘Patrick’ paintings – and Brian Epstein.\n“The painting was purchased by the art director and graphic designer Alan Aldridge, who went on to use it as the frontispiece to The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics, published in 1969. It was later used as the cover of The Beatles Ballads LP 12 years later.\n“Rumours suggest the original large-scale work was lost by EMI records, and so this work being offered for sale by Lyon & Turnbull is a rare surviving early version.\n“There is only one other known example, in a private collection in America.\n“We anticipate a great deal of interest in the sale and look forward to some spirited bidding at home and abroad.”",

The new draft plan development process began with independent consultation, which took place through surveys, community drop-in sessions in Kirkwall, Stenness and Dounby, and engagement with local businesses, community groups, membership organisations, and education providers.\nREAD MORE:\nDig It: How Orkney’s archaeology is stealing the show on the small screen\nThe 'extraordinary' neolithic village in Scotland that's older than the Pyramids\nNeolithic site to be returned to green fields after dig\nThe draft plan builds on previous measures to further mitigate the site’s vulnerability to climate change, which threatens communities, environments and world heritage sites across the globe.\nThe Heart of Neolithic Orkney is vulnerable to the sea level changes, precipitation changes, and storm intensity and frequency increases that Scotland and other places are experiencing on a more elevated scale.\nThe consultation is also seeking views on how to further balance access to tourists and residents while maintaining the Heart of Neolithic Orkney’s \"outstanding universal value\". Increased footfall can also contribute to erosion of sites - particularly at the Ring of Brodgar, where measures have been introduced to alleviate the impact on the monument and surrounding area, such as a one-way system and alternating routes around the site.\nInput is being sought from across the islands and beyond to further shape the direction of the plan. The draft plan also lays out how continued engagement with Orkney communities, including the infrastructure surrounding the site, will be a focal point in the sites’ management for the next 10 years, which emerged as a key priority from consultations with the public.\nDr James Bruhn, Head of World Heritage and Heritage Policy at HES, said: \"As one of Scotland’s seven World Heritage sites, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney is an integral part of Scotland’s story with international appeal, and how we look after it, share and celebrate it is hugely important.\nSkara Brae “We’re keen to hear from as many people as possible as part of the consultation and would encourage those who wish to help shape the next ten years for the Heart of Neolithic Orkney, and be part of its continuing story, to take part.”\nCouncillor Heather Woodbridge, Leader of Orkney Islands Council, said: “The Heart of Neolithic Orkney - encompassing four incredible sites in the West Mainland - is vital to the ongoing story that weaves through Orkney’s past, present and future.\n\"The community of Orkney has looked after these sites for generations, particularly in terms of providing a warm welcome to those who come to our shores to visit them.\n“As we face the challenges of climate and changing visitor patterns, it is important that we take the time to review, alongside our partners, how the sites are being managed now and into the future.\n“Our community are an important part of this - and I’d encourage them to make their views known.”\nThe consultation closes on Tuesday May 13.",

So, we now need to make sure that we do realise those efficiency savings so we can invest in the priorities.”\nDuring the interview, the Chancellor also refused to rule out slashing tax on tech giants.\nThere have been reports that the government might consider changing or ditching the Digital Services Tax, which imposes a 2% levy on the profits of firms like Facebook, in order to avoid the global tariffs that the Trump administration is planning to impose.\nAsked if this was true, Ms Reeves said the UK is in discussions \"around a whole range of things\" with the US related to tariffs.\n\"But we will continue to operate on that principle that you should pay taxes in the country in which you operate.\"\nAsked if she might tweak the tax, she said: \"You've got to get the balance right, and those discussions at the moment are ongoing.\n\"We want to make progress. We do not want to see British exporters subject to higher tariffs, and we want to see trade barriers fall right across the world.\"\nREAD MORE\nIn his interview, Mr Leishman also said his party has not done enough for the 400 workers at Grangemouth being made redundant.\nThe MP suggested using the redevelopment of Manchester United’s Old Trafford stadium as a bargaining chip.\nThe club is owned by billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is chairman and chief executive of the site’s part-owners, Ineos.\nPlans for the new stadium were announced earlier this year, but the club is looking for Government support to regenerate the surrounding area. The money for which, Mr Leishman says, should be withheld if the refinery closes.\n“When we look at the regeneration needed around Old Trafford, why would we not say you can have that money, but you need to keep Grangemouth open? That’s just negotiation in my opinion,” he told the magazine.\n“I have asked those questions of why we haven’t done this, and the answers have been underwhelming.”",

These particles can travel millions of miles, and some may eventually collide with the Earth.\n“Most of these particles are deflected away, but some become captured in the Earth’s magnetic field, accelerating down towards the north and south poles into the atmosphere. This is why aurora activity is concentrated at the magnetic poles.”\nRoyal Observatory astronomer, Tom Kerss added: “These particles then slam into atoms and molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere and essentially heat them up.\n“We call this physical process ‘excitation’, but it’s very much like heating a gas and making it glow.”\nThe Northern Lights are usually seen in extreme polar regions (Image: Getty Images)\nThe best places to the Northern Lights\nThe Royal Museums Greenwich said: “The aurora borealis can be seen in the northern hemisphere, while the aurora australis is found in the southern hemisphere.\n“While the best places to see the aurora are concentrated around the polar regions, the aurora borealis can sometimes be seen in the UK.\n“The further north you are the more likely you are to see the display – but heightened solar activity has meant that the northern lights have been seen as far south as Cornwall and Brighton.\n“The conditions do still need to be right however. Dark and clear nights, preferably with little light pollution, offer the best chance of seeing the aurora.”",

God love them.\nOh oh oh\nEverywhere we go\nWatching Albion Rovers\nPutting on a show.\nJanet Prentice, who’s in charge of the boardroom hospitality is introducing me to her nephew, four-year-old Magnus Forbes Prentice Campbell.\n“He was a shareholder at one year old,” says Janet. “Everyone who comes through these doors is treated like family. If that wasn’t the case there’d be little point in keeping it going.\n\"If Albion Rovers was forced to close, the impact would be felt across the entire community. But I’m sensing that more locals are becoming aware of our plight and are stepping up.”\nThis is where amidst a picture gallery of club heroes like their former manager and ex-Rangers star, Davie Provan.\nRead More: Why whisky tasting was the most Scottish moment in my life\nThere’s a picture of one John Smith, a supporter who was inducted into the Albion Rovers Hall of Fame who began supporting the club during the second world war and was “one of the few supporters to remember the Rovers playing in top flight league football during season 1947-48”.\nThat team of legends included Jock Stein, who made 236 appearances for the Rovers before moving to Llanelli in Wales and then to captain Celtic where he emerged as the most important figure in the history of the Hoops.\nIt’s at this point you have to ask the question: couldn’t Celtic, the richest club in Scotland, spare a few bob to help out this one which is woven into their history.\nGenerations of Coatbridge families have provided support for Celtic. Surely there is still sufficient sentiment amidst their fiduciary corporate responsibilities to help the Rovers in their darkest hours?\nRonnie Boyd gently steers me away from this line of thought and talks about Celtic and Rangers having to be run as businesses in a fiercely competitive market.\nAnd so he introduces me to Chris Ide, the club doctor, who’s been providing this service for 19 seasons and refused to take a penny in return.\nHe’d originally been a Portsmouth supporter and I’m eager to tell him about my guilty (and utterly useless passion) of learning football lists in my youth, including the fact that Portsmouth won back to back league titles in 1949 and 1950 and that, having won the FA Cup in 1939 before the outbreak of war, they’re the longest-ever holders of the trophy.\nIt’s a form of madness, but today I’m overjoyed that at last someone has appreciated it.\n“My functions are mainly now ornamental,” he says. “I make the tea and help with stadium maintenance.”\nAt the back of the bar, there’s a young team discussing their plans for the evening.\nLet me introduce you to Jason Watson, Jack (Shug) Donnelly, Ryan Kelly and Nathan McPherson.\n“There’s nowhere else we’d rather be on a Saturday afternoon,” says Ryan, who like many others around here, has forsaken Celtic’s Hollywood attractions to follow the Rovers.\n“This is where I’ve made friends for life,” says Jason.\n“It’s one of the places where I’m at my happiest and we’ll do everything to help this club get through this.”\nA thorny nest of boardroom politics has brought Albion Rovers to this parlous state.\nRead More: SNP’s departing MSPs represent the worst of us. They won't be missed\nThis is a private limited company and though the overwhelming majority of shareholders have sought to co-opt new members with expertise and ideas to move the club forward they’ve been blocked at every turn by a handful of large shareholders, led by a single individual.\nNo explanations have been forthcoming as they’re not obliged to justify their reasoning. The others can only guess darkly at their motives.\n“More than 100k a year has gone from our budget after we dropped out of the fourth tier of the senior leagues two seasons ago,” says Ronnie.\n“But that’s what we need if we are to continue paying our players and coaching staff.\n\"I don’t know how long we could sustain this club in these circumstances, but I do know this: I can live with us turning amateur if it means I can still watch them playing on that turf.”\nHis colleague, Donnie Lind, whose grandfather attended Rovers’ only Scottish Cup final against Kilmarnock in 1920 (attendance: 95,000) said: “Another problem is that even when we played clubs like Stenhousemuir, they brought a core travelling support of about 150 which makes a significant difference.\n\"Now we’re playing the likes of Stirling University whose travelling support is a few students with Pot Noodles.”\nThey’re immediate hopes may now rest on a planned artificial pitch behind one of the goals which would enable them to charge rental for community use.\n“It’s a race against the clock, though,” says Ronnie Boyd.\nAt 5.49 on Saturday afternoon, Rovers are edging towards a drab 0-0 draw that suits neither team.\nThe playing surface would put many loftier clubs to shame and there have been flashes of skill, not least from Rovers’ big Spanish teenage striker, Bright Prince Okosun, (although I spend the second half urging him to put his considerable physical presence to better use).\nBut what do I know? The big man’s only gone and sent a towering header past the keeper to secure all three points.\nThe stand erupts and I’m happier that I’d ever expected to be at the outcome of a game in the fifth tier of Scottish football in North Lanarkshire.\n“If you come to the Rovers and don’t fall in love with them then there’s something wrong with you,” says Mary Allen.\nShe speaks the truth, because I’m putting my name down for a season ticket.",

      "content_en": "A senior police chief has unveiled a plan to charge more domestic abusers with manslaughter after their partners take their own lives. It comes after the death of Kiena Dawes, whose partner Ryan Wellings was cleared of manslaughter but convicted of domestic abuse.\nWellings had subjected Dawes to repeated assaults and verbal abuse before she killed herself and left a suicide note on her phone in which she described Wellings as a monster, stating: “Slowly … Ryan Wellings killed me.”\nHe was jailed in January for six and a half years.\nThe case was referred to at the launch of the annual national police report on domestic homicides.\nIt revealed that the most common cause of death among domestic abuse victims in England and Wales, in the year to the end of March 2024, was suspected suicide for the second year running.\nIt was only the second time a man has stood trial for causing his partner’s suicide, with the first in 2006 also resulting in an acquittal. The charge has been successfully brought only once: in 2017, when Nicholas Allen pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Justene Reece.\nThe jury heard repeated evidence of the violence Wellings meted out on Dawes including: trying to strangle her with an iPhone charger cable; screaming at her that she was a “slag”, throwing a stool at her and telling her to kill herself; putting a drill to her face and saying he would drill her teeth out of her mouth; and threatening to make Dawes look like the TV presenter and acid attack survivor Katie Piper.\nWhile he was jailed for six and a half years for assault and coercive and controlling behaviour, Dawes’s mother said “justice has not been done in the way we all hoped”.\nAssistant commissioner Louisa Rolfe, the National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for domestic abuse, said it was “heartening” that more investigations are being launched into deaths after domestic abuse, and spoke of her regret that a manslaughter conviction had not been achieved in the case.\nThis was despite the “excellent” work of investigators and the “extensive trail” left by the Dawes family, she added.\nAnother case cited by Rolfe on Monday was one in which a woman died after she was pushed from a rocky outcrop at a Scottish beauty spot, as part of a police investigation looking more deeply into whether domestic abuse was a hidden factor in unexpected deaths.\nFawziyah Javed, 31, died when she was pushed from Arthur’s Seat in Edinburgh by her abusive husband Kashif Anwar, who falsely claimed he had slipped and bumped into her while the couple were on holiday in 2021.\nAnwar, 29, from Leeds, was found guilty of the murder of his wife and causing the death of her unborn child. She had used her dying words to reveal it was Anwar who pushed her, telling a witness: “Don’t let my husband near me, he pushed me.”\nIn April 2023, Anwar was sentenced to a minimum prison sentence of 20 years.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

      "content_en": "For nearly four years, a fierce debate raged over the future of the Wyndford estate in Glasgow, dividing residents and sparking wider national controversy. Was the demolition of its high-rises an environmental travesty or the first step toward much-needed regeneration?\nThe dispute began in November 2021, days after the city hosted the UN climate conference Cop26, at which politicians and businesses promised to curb wasteful building destruction. Yet residents of Wyndford soon found leaflets on their doorsteps heralding a “bright new dawn” – one that involved the demolition of all four high-rise blocks on the estate. The decision set off years of protests, legal challenges and community divisions.\nThe fight came to a head on Sunday, when three of the four 1960s tower blocks were finally reduced to rubble in a controlled demolition.\nWyndford estate was built between 1961 and 1969 on the site of a former military barracks. Commissioned by the Harold Macmillan government, it was intended as an exemplar of high-quality public housing, a rebuttal to Glasgow’s legacy of cheap and poorly planned social accommodation.\nView image in fullscreen The four high-rise blocks of the Wyndford estate one week before demolition. Three blocks were demolished by controlled explosion on 23 March – the block on the left will be brought down floor by floor because of its proximity to other homes on the estate\nBut 60 years later, part of that vision had faded. Its one-bedroom high-rise flats had become synonymous with short-term tenancies, and labelled a hotspot of neglect and social deprivation. Wheatley Group, Scotland’s largest landlord, argued that the blocks were no longer fit for purpose and should be replaced with modern family homes.\nA determined coalition of residents, activists, and conservationists, led by the Wyndford Residents Union (WRU), fiercely opposed the demolitions. At the heart of their campaign was a belief that the destruction of social housing during a housing crisis was not only irresponsible but unnecessary.\nBring down these flats and give the people the houses that they have been crying out for Henry Mclaren\nView image in fullscreen Henry McLaren, a Wyndford resident and focus group member\nDespite the protests, occupations, and legal challenges, Wheatley Group remained steadfast. Aisling Mylrea, the director of Wheatley Homes Glasgow, emphasised that legal challenges had been shut down every time and that all the permissions had been in place for the demolition to go ahead. She said: “Over 85% of the tenants of the scheme support the demolition and the £100m investment that will follow for the area.”\nHenry McLaren, a Wyndford resident and member of the Future Focus Group set up by Wheatley, said: “ This will be all good for the community. The words ‘focus’ and ‘future’ are important – everyone needs to stay focused on the end goal.”\nThey’ve run this place down – making it the worst place to live. Now they want to blow up the flats and make it the best Laura Jones\nView image in fullscreen Laura Jones, 38, Wyndford resident\nFrom the outset, Wheatley Group insisted that retrofitting the high-rise flats and making them into larger homes was impossible and continually pointed to the declining popularity of high-rise social housing. However, many campaigners disputed the claim that retrofitting was unviable.\nA coalition of architects, conservationists and engineers conducted studies suggesting the buildings could have been modernised and repurposed. Malcolm Fraser, a leading architect and campaigner, also called into question the 85% figure cited for support of the demolition, arguing that no alternative to demolition was ever seriously presented. “That number reflects only the few hundred tenants who responded, and they were never given the option of retrofitting,” he said.\nWe’ve been surrounded by rubble for months. The last block nearest to me … is being brought down piece by piece Caz\nView image in fullscreen Caz, a member of Wyndford Residents Union\nAs the demolition date approached, tensions mounted. For many residents, the stark reality of the controlled explosions in their neighbourhood took centre stage. Fears of further protests and block occupations prompted demolition contractors to station 24-hour security at the entrance to each tower. People living near the demolition site expressed concerns for their homes, and were angered after being offered a £100 Tesco voucher as compensation for vacating their properties for up to 10 hours on the day of the blast.\nThis place was beautiful when we moved in here … It’s different now … it all feels like a mad rush just to get us out Angie Thompson\nView image in fullscreen Angie Thompson, a Wyndford resident\nWheatley Group assured the residents that all safety measures had been met, stating: “Safedem are world-leading demolition contractors. They have carried out similar demolitions worldwide, ensuring all asbestos and hazardous materials were removed in advance.”\nView image in fullscreen Nick Durie, an Alba party politician and member of the Wyndford Residents Union\nWheatley Group says it wants to replace the 600 one-bedroom and bedsit flats with 400 new family homes, citing an urgent need for larger, modern housing in Glasgow. Yet campaigners remain unconvinced that this will truly benefit the community, given the overall reduction in social housing units. As the dust settled on demolition day, Nick Durie, an Alba politician and WRU member, made it clear that the battle was far from over. “This isn’t the end – it’s just the beginning. Our fight will continue long after the demolition. We will protest and challenge every stage of the new development until they commit to replacing all 600 social homes they’ve torn down,” he said.\nWe will continue to fight their planning application and to politicise it Nick Durie\nBeyond the loss of homes, the demolition has drawn criticism from climate activists and architects alarmed by the environmental toll. With an estimated 47,000 tonnes of embodied carbon released in the demolition process, some argue that the destruction contradicts the climate commitments made at Cop26.\nView image in fullscreen William Doolan, a Wyndford resident.\nI won’t be watching the demolition, don’t want to see it happening, it was my home William Doolan\nFraser summed up the frustration: “I know that every building we put up today will last about 40 years. These flats, if properly retrofitted, could have lasted for centuries. We need to stop this cycle of waste and destruction.”\nA UK-wide policy that exempts new buildings and demolitions from VAT has only reinforced the preference for demolition over retrofitting. Critics warn that without policy changes, the cycle will continue: “Big business thrives on knocking down old buildings, landfilling them and starting again. And so it goes on and on.”\nView image in fullscreen The four high-rise blocks of the Wyndford estate one week before demolition\nThree of Wyndford’s towers have now been reduced to rubble, joining the many high-rise schemes that have vanished from Glasgow’s skyline. Yet the battle over their legacy – debates on the environmental cost of demolition and the future of social housing – remains far from settled.",

      "content_en": "Scottish voters are divided over Scotland’s policy of free tuition for Scottish students as the crisis over university finances intensified.\nA poll commissioned by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland found that up to 48% of voters believe Scottish students who can afford it should pay for tuition, with 29% opposed.\nA different multiple-choice question produced a closer result. It found 43% believed those who could afford to should pay, while 44% felt every student should get free tuition.\nScottish universities are among a growing number across the UK in deep financial peril, with Dundee expected to be the first to receive part of a £10m government bailout.\nFree tuition for undergraduates was first introduced in 2008 by the Scottish National party, in a vote-winning move to scrap the graduate endowment tax then used to partly pay for tuition in Scotland.\nHowever, free tuition has come under much greater scrutiny after Dundee University revealed it was on the brink of insolvency, while Edinburgh University plans to cut £140m to avoid going into deficit.\nScottish universities receive £7,610 per head to teach Scottish students, less than the £9,250 English and Welsh universities can charge, at a total cost of about £715m a year.\nThat means universities rely on foreign students paying full-cost fees to subsidise teaching costs for Scottish students. The number of overseas students coming to Scotland fell by 10,000 in 2023-24, adding to the financial pressures and increasing competition between universities.\nThe free tuition policy also means the Scottish government caps the number of Scottish students who can go to university, which prevents some Scots from getting the university places they want.\nThe trust, set up in 1901 by the Scottish-born US industrialist Andrew Carnegie, is establishing a citizens’ jury to review how Scottish universities should be funded.\nIt will be formed in April with 22 participants of different backgrounds taking part in six online evidence sessions. It is due to report in January 2026, four months before the next Scottish parliament election.\nHannah Garrow, the trust’s chief executive, said it believed there was an evidence gap about what voters really thought. “We’ve known for some time that something needs to change. We need to have a more open and nuanced debate about it.”\nA spokesperson for Universities Scotland, the sector’s representative body, supported the move. “For far too long Scotland’s conversation about university funding has been in a binary loop of free versus fees. It’s time to move beyond that,” she said.\nThe Scottish government said its commitment to free tuition would not change. “Access to higher education should be based on the ability to learn – not the ability to pay,” a spokesperson said.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Staff at Brunel University of London will strike for three days to protest against more than 400 job cuts.\nAlthough universities in England receive more tuition funding per student than their peers in Scotland, they receive less in direct grants from government, and the value of domestic fees has been sharply eroded by inflation.",

      "content_en": "It is the UK’s largest body of fresh water, its volume totalling more than all the lakes of England and Wales combined. It is also the UK’s greatest source of daft stories. For the best part of a century, Loch Ness has used its monster-adjacent status not only to finance a healthy tourist economy, but also to generate a small industry in Nessie-related fiction, from the inspired to the crackpot. The Simpsons sent Mr Burns to do battle with the creature in an episode called Monty Can’t Buy Me Love. From the pen of poet Ted Hughes came Nessie the Mannerless Monster, who was tired of being told she does not exist. And indie folkster Matilda Mann has a song called The Loch Ness Monster, containing this advice: “Stay right down there.” Not wanting to be left out, the Royal Mail has just honoured Nessie with a fine, if rather unscary, stamp.\nTo these slithery ranks we will shortly be able to add Nessie, a family musical written and composed by Glasgow’s Shonagh Murray and about to premiere in Edinburgh and Pitlochry. Murray was reluctant to tackle such a familiar Scottish icon, until a challenge from her father drew her in. “I had just finished doing a couple of shows about the women behind Robert Burns,” she says. “I was joking with my dad that I needed to find something a wee bit less Scottish. He was like: ‘Oh, there’s loads of Scottish stories that have been told – but not to their full potential. You should do a Nessie musical.’ On a dare, I wrote an opening number. The more I was writing, the more I liked it. There was something charming and special about it.”\nI never met the monster, said the writer of The Secret of the Loch after her research, but I did find a wonderful whisky\nDespite claims to the contrary, the story goes back no further than May 1933. That was when hotel proprietor Donaldina Mackay and her husband John, driving along the north shore of the loch, claimed to have seen a large creature on the surface. They said it resembled a whale and described it rolling for a minute before disappearing. Their testimony, reported by the Inverness Courier, set off a summer of sighting claims. At the time, the dinosaur-battling King Kong was becoming a monster hit in cinemas, but here was a fearsome creature on Scotland’s very own soil (or loch).\nView image in fullscreen Mr Burns and the monster … The Simpsons. Photograph: Youtube\nBy October, the Scotsman newspaper, having gathered several testimonies, was declaring: “The fact that the loch does contain a creature much larger than any loch fish is evidently beyond all question.” People did question it, however – and only two days later, the same paper quoted a zoology professor speculating that the creature was a “large lump of waterlogged peat”. His view was countered by those who reckoned it was a plesiosaurus that had missed the memo about extinction.\nAny good myth needs a backstory and Nessie advocates were soon looking around for some ancient pedigree. Step forward St Columba who, in the sixth century, supposedly fended off a “certain aquatic monster” by making the sign of the cross. This took place at the river Ness and not the loch, but it was all the evidence they needed to show Nessie had staying power. No one dwelt on the fact that, according to Adomnán, the saint’s biographer, Columba had form on this kind of thing, having variously silenced a storm, raised a boy from the dead, and turned a pail of milk into a demon.\n“There are so many could-be-real sightings and so many hoax sightings,” says Murray. “But I like the not knowing. I like the mystery of it and the idea the natural world is playing a trick on us.”\nView image in fullscreen ‘Terrible’ … an iguana as Nessie in 1934’s The Secret of the Loch. Photograph: Youtube\nFilm-makers quickly jumped on board the Nessie bandwagon. Released a year after that first sighting, The Secret of the Loch was a lighthearted romance that culminated in a young London reporter having an underwater showdown with Nessie. It was edited by David Lean, no less, and called “terrible” by its own writer, Charles Bennett, who co-wrote it with a woman called Billie Bristow. The pair went to Scotland for research, with Bristow declaring: “I never met the monster, but I found a wonderful scotch whisky.” The monster, meanwhile, was played by a young green iguana.\nView image in fullscreen Rather unscary … the new stamp. Photograph: Royal Mail/PA\nFor all its faults, The Secret of the Loch set out what elements were required for this new genre. Choose pretty much any Nessie movie – from 2001’s appalling Beneath Loch Ness, shot mainly in California, to 1996’s Loch Ness, which is worth seeing for Keith Allen as a deranged Nessie hunter – and charge your glasses for a drinking game of monster proportions. Your task is to spot arrogant outsiders, stereotyped locals and sceptical scientists. There are bonus shots for unconvincing special effects, and if you plan to sink a wee dram for every terrible Scottish accent, you should first seek medical advice.\nIn The Secret of the Loch, Frederick Peisley plays the cub reporter Jimmy Andrews, who is determined to get a story out of one of the few scientists convinced the monster is real. Even before he leaves London, Jimmy is trying out his highland flings and hackneyed Scottish phrases. Once he gets to Loch Ness, he finds himself in a low-ceilinged tavern where the drinkers are as cautious with their money as they are with their conversation.\nMuch the same pub with much the same clientele appears in every subsequent Nessie film. But there is one change: it tends to be loud-mouthed Americans, rather than patrician Englishmen, who treat Scotland so condescendingly. Countless curmudgeonly locals are shown knocking back whisky, withholding hospitality and fighting ancient clan battles, while the sophisticated incomers sort out fact from fiction. A rare exception is the 1980s cartoon series The Family-Ness, which is told from the perspective of local children (not that you would know from the accents).\nView image in fullscreen Kids are the key … final touches for the new musical Nessie. Photograph: Fraser Band\nAs the composer of Nessie, Murray is allowing herself to lean into the Scottishness, but with more authenticity. “It’s Scottish folk meeting musical theatre,” she says when we meet at Pitlochry Festival theatre and look out at the rolling hills and the tree-lined River Tummel with its famous fish ladder. “We’re nodding to the heritage of where the story is. I came up here when I was writing and I would walk in the gardens and over the dam. It massively sped up my writing process. The music has a flow in the underwater moments and gives a grounding to the moments that need a callback to Scottish trad, rather than Instagram.”\nAs the excellent Mythillogical podcast points out in its Nessie special, The Secret of the Loch also established a trope about the scientific establishment. For belief in the monster to persist, a way must be found to dismiss any rational objectors, so nearly every movie features a diehard sceptic who is ultimately proved wrong in the most dramatic, tumultuous fashion, invariably by the appearance of the monster, rather fabulously in the case of that iguana.\nAppropriately, given the number of fraudsters who have targeted Nessie, another common plotline is forgery. In fact, many of the most accomplished – and certainly funniest – films have been about fakes. In their short film Another Fine Ness, the Chuckle Brothers turn the monster lore into a joke as they fake footprints and whip out a tartan glove puppet in an attempt to win a Nessie-spotting competition. Similarly, in the 1961 comedy What a Whopper, Adam Faith plays a hard-up writer who thinks he might find a market for his Nessie book if he contrives a sighting. As his scheme goes hilariously wrong, he comes up with this superb justification for his plan: “I had psychology on my side: they wanted to see something.”\nView image in fullscreen ‘Interested in the difference between fact and truth’ … Werner Herzog in Incident at Loch Ness.\nBest of all is the mockumentary Incident at Loch Ness, a great cineaste in-joke in which Werner Herzog is followed by a film crew as he supposedly makes a documentary called The Enigma of Loch Ness. “I’ve always been interested in the difference between fact and truth,” deadpans the director of Fitzcarraldo and Grizzly Man hilariously, as he asks his producer to find an “obsessed but credible” cryptozoologist to interview. His other requests include shots of Highland games, whisky, urchins and a “shepherd with a flock”. Herzog also has a thing about beards. The more he seeks the truth, the more his producer tries to fake the monster – and the more the “real” monster intervenes.\nMurray, for her part, is partly using the legend to question our relationship with the environment. “So many people are flippant and dismissive of the Loch Ness monster,” she says. “You’re more likely to buy into its magic through children. For Mara, our lead character, it’s about speaking up for the natural world that she loves – and cutting through the noise of the adult voices.”",

This cycle of violence must end.”\nAmen’s sister Delina Teklay, 17, previously told BBC Scotland that her brother hoped to gain UK citizenship and become a doctor or engineer. She said: “This was very unexpected and shocking for us. I just think this is a dream and I’m going to wake up tomorrow. I’m still in denial.”\nThe 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with Amen’s murder and assault, while the 15-year-old was charged with assault.\nPolice said the 16-year-old will appear in court in due course, and that a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.",

      "content_en": "Holyrood is becoming a “hostile environment for women” and a significant number of female MSPs in the Scottish National party are stepping down before the May 2026 elections, citing lack of support from the party, tolerance of bullying, and abuse in the chamber and online.\nAlmost four years on from the election of a record number of 58 female MSPs across all parties in 2021, 14 SNP women have so far said they will not stand again, accounting for 23% of the party’s current MSP group.\nWhile some departures were expected, such as the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon and the 80-year-old veteran Christine Grahame, other exits raise questions about why women with seemingly burgeoning careers are choosing to step away.\nMichelle Thomson, who is standing down as MSP for Falkirk East, having previously served at Westminster, told the Guardian: “Politics is generally very misogynist, and I don’t think the SNP can be complacent about its own internal mechanisms which mean that examples of inappropriate male behaviour – including bullying and sexual harassment – are not tackled.”\nElena Whitham, an SNP former minister and another MSP not seeking re-election, said: “It’s not just about barriers to entry but to staying in politics. Neither party nor parliament are able to effectively support women when they encounter difficulties, and that’s why we are losing far too many talented women to the detriment of democracy.”\nThese concerns were shared by other SNP women who told the Guardian there was a chronic lack of support from the party, including for those with younger families. Some mentioned factional tensions and bullying within the party involving other female MSPs.\nNatalie Don-Innes is standing down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, citing “the sacrifices that being an elected member and a mother brings”.\nBut other women raised concerns about the Holyrood environment itself.\n“The bullying, booing and braying from the Tory benches whenever an SNP woman makes a progressive intervention is awful. Women feel they can’t speak up, especially on issues like LGBT+ inclusion,” said one former party official who regularly visited the parliament.\nOthers worry that the atmosphere will get worse if Reform UK wins upwards of 10 Holyrood seats, as polling predicts, and if former SNP MPs ousted in the party’s catastrophic general election defeat last July bring a more combative Westminster culture to the Scottish parliament.\nSome fear this is already happening, after reports that allies of the SNP’s leader in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, have a “hitlist” of sitting MSPs – all women – whom they hope to replace with former MPs in May next year.\nFlynn faced a fierce backlash last autumn when he announced that he planned to stand for Holyrood – potentially pushing out the incumbent female MSP – while maintaining his Westminster seat.\nHolyrood sources said that in addition to what could be bruising contests to select candidates, there were concerns the SNP would face a very difficult election because of its funding difficulties and a substantial drop in membership after the police investigation into its finances.\nIt is understood that has also weighed on some MSPs’ thinking.\nThis is all happening against a background of increasing online abuse, with a recent Holyrood magazine survey finding that female MSPs of all parties faced rape threats, death threats and severe misogynistic abuse.\nAlthough the SNP’s leader, John Swinney, has maintained Sturgeon’s tradition of a gender-balanced cabinet, some women described themselves as “furious” and “appalled” that equal representation reforms brought in by Sturgeon, including ensuring all-women lists where MSPs stood down, had been ditched for the next election.\nThe SNP said its legal advice was that because it achieved a 50/50 gender balance in 2021, it could not put in place similar corrective mechanisms this time.\nThe approved candidates list, circulated to SNP members last week, included 64 women (42%) out of a total of 152.\nThomson said there was “a very real risk that the SNP could take a significant step back in 2026”, pointing too to the lack of diversity among the approved men on the list.\n“The SNP put in all-women shortlists without looking at the systemic misogyny within the party,” said one prominent backbencher, “and it just elected women to a tough position with very little support. Holyrood is becoming a hostile environment for women.”",

      "content_en": "Star/Steer is a masterpiece from 1968 by the Scottish artist Ian Hamilton Finlay (1925-2006). What you see can be simply described. The word “star” appears a dozen times, screenprinted in silver on deep grey. They graduate down the page in a swaying column. Right at the bottom is a 13th word, “steer”, as if tethering – or guided by – all these descending stars.\nEach star is like an instance of itself, glimmering out of a fog, and the winding pattern irresistibly evokes starlight on rippling water. You look up to the stars, and down to the invisible boat summoned by that noun-verb “steer”. Which star to follow, how to navigate at sea, what the night skies can hold: the work is a visualisation, a poem and a prayer.\nView image in fullscreen Star/Steer, 1968 by Ian Hamilton Finlay: ‘a poem and a prayer’. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\nFinlay achieves all these sublime effects purely through the subtle arrangement of two words against two colours. His is an art of distillation, juxtaposition, thrift and contemplation. A poet before he became a concrete poet, a sculptor who became an “avant gardener”, as he put it, of that fabled landscape known as Little Sparta in the Pentland Hills beyond Edinburgh, Finlay understood as few other artists the emotional power of letters cutting into form, shape and colour.\nYou sense it over and again in this wonderful centenary commemoration at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. It’s there in the blue and white screenprint Evening Sail, which consists of the words “Evening Will Come They Will Sew the Blue Sail” running in classical script down a long deep blue banner, as if to suggest both the sail and the mariners’ shrouds sewn in antiquity from such sails at the end of the day. It’s there in the scarlet invectives, so exquisitely lettered on his behalf by Nicholas Sloan, against the government quangos Finlay despised: Pereant Tyranni Nummari (Let Perish the Money Tyrants).\nView image in fullscreen ‘Scarlet invectives’: Posters against the SAC: Pereant Tyranni Nummari (with Nicholas Sloan). Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\nAnd it runs through this show, as through his Pentlands garden, incised in all kinds of stone. A tank is delicately inserted into the pastoral relief Et in Arcadia Ego, embodying Virgil’s ringing memento mori, carved in the marble below. A bird table for Finlay’s garden doubles as a miniature aircraft carrier (imagine the birds landing and taking off), the letter E incised into its deck, a reference to the USS Enterprise, the longest nuclear-powered carrier in the world.\nOne gallery is filled with haunting photographs of Finlay’s artists’ signatures at Little Sparta, including his tribute to Albrecht Dürer. Above a stand of tall grass resembling Dürer’s own Great Piece of Turf, hangs his famous AD monogram incised in stone – as if Dürer had himself signed nature.\nHis art scarcely seems to comply with an embattled personality at constant war with institutions\nFinlay selects the mot juste with a poet’s precision. Take a work such as Wave Rock from 1966. The word “wave” runs back and forth, horizontally, up against a vertical heap of the word “rock”. The waves meet, depart, always unpredictable in their encounter with the rocks. Look closer, and the words “wreak” and “wreck” become discernible in the collision of letters. And all these words are etched on a sheet of sandblasted glass propped up in a bit of driftwood, like a letter in a rack. Everything flows, and connects.\nFinlay’s art is so refined, philosophical, antic in its wit and elegance, that it scarcely seems to comply with an embattled personality at constant war with institutions, galleries and publishers. But his long-running conflicts were notorious. A vivid gallery of films and photographs recounts his 1980s campaign against Strathclyde council for trying to force him to pay business rates on an old byre that he had converted into a classical temple. Local farmers joined in, blocking the marauding tax officials with their tractors. I especially like the poster Shock Tropes for Little Sparta (Sparta, of course, was at war with Athens).\nView image in fullscreen Wave Rock, 1966. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\n“Mors Concilio Artium” (Death to the Arts Council) is inscribed on blazing prints. When the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) accidentally returned some of Finlay’s stone carvings, his revenge was classical. The names of council functionaries, along with other enemies – including well-known painters and poets such as Elizabeth Blackadder and Iain Crichton Smith – are now carved in perpetuity on the back, along with a rousing tribute to Robespierre. Not incidentally, the SAC eventually gave them to the nation.\nThe French Revolution, battles on land and sea, historical warfare – all have enduring significance in Finlay’s art. He joined up in the second world war and his own position is always ambiguous. Two curious stone boots, exquisitely carved by John Andrew, are in fact representations of the funnels of the Mikuma, a Japanese cruiser deployed during the war. Terrifying on a vast scale, they are reduced to what Finlay ironically called paperweights. But lest we forget, the Mikuma was sunk in 1942 by the US with most of its crew.\nView image in fullscreen Et in Arcadia Ego, 1976 by Finlay, with John Andrew. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay © the estate of John Andrew\nIt feels apt that such a show should take place in the neoclassical grandeur of the former Dean Orphanage in Edinburgh. One of the most immaculate works here – poised between antiquity and conceptualism – is the tiny Marble Paper Boat, in which an origami vessel crests the fluted waves of a stone finial that would not look out of place in the Georgian architecture of the city’s New Town.\nIf only this exhibition stretched from the ground floor to the upper galleries too. But Finlay is widely spread in his centenary year, with several other shows, including one at Victoria Miro, London (30 April-24 May), and an illustrated book of essays by writers including the late, lamented Tom Lubbock.\nWhat makes this particular exhibition so special, moreover, is its emphasis on the intimate: many small sculptures raised up to perfect viewing levels on plinths, the walls dense with exquisite screenprints. What you see is Finlay’s mind in closeup – words and ideas forming into two- and three-dimensional works of unique and visionary art.",

[As] I have said to all of you many times, I have done nothing wrong, so I was confident of reaching this point but obviously it is a relief now to have that confirmed,” she said.\n“For almost two years I have had this cloud of investigation hanging over me. It won’t surprise anybody to hear me say that’s not been an easy experience, so to reach this point today is obviously something I am relieved about. I’ve been trying to go on with my life and I now intend to do that.”\nBeattie told reporters at Holyrood on Thursday he was very relieved to have been cleared, and said he intended to stand again for parliament next year.\n“I knew myself I had done nothing wrong but two years is a long time to wait for a result,” he said. “I’ve had tremendous support from constituents and members. I can at least relax and get back to family life now.”\nThe confirmation came after it emerged that Murrell, who served as the SNP’s chief executive for 22 years, had made no plea during his court appearance, a routine hearing that formally begins the prosecution process.\nThe Crown Office has not yet released the charge against him.\nMurrell was arrested in April 2023 after police came to the home he then shared with Sturgeon in Uddingston, as police mounted a simultaneous raid on the SNP’s headquarters near the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.\nPolice erected tents outside their detached home, carrying out extensive searches of the property and its garden and shed, while removing documents and computers from their home and the SNP’s offices.\nPolice later confiscated a luxury motorhome parked outside Murrell’s mother’s home in Fife.\nAfter being released pending further investigation, Murrell was rearrested on 18 April 2024 and charged with embezzlement. In late 2024, Police Scotland submitted an extensive report to the Crown Office, setting out the evidence it had gathered.\nMurrell has made no public comment about his arrest or the investigation, but Sturgeon has repeatedly said she was innocent of any wrongdoing since her arrest in June 2023.\nSturgeon, whose memoirs will be published in August, announced in January that she and Murrell were to divorce and indicated they had been living separate lives for some time. Earlier in March, she confirmed she would not be standing for re-election to Holyrood in next year’s Scottish parliament elections.",

You can’t help but want to go out on your bike.”\nThe Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, described the spectacle of the race as “the only sports event made for people who don’t like sport” and recalled seeing riders applauding spectators in Yorkshire in 2014. “That’s very rare,” he said.\nThere will be six Tour stages in total in the UK in 2027, three stages of the men’s Tour and three of the women’s race. “I think it’s brilliant,” Cavendish said. “Cycling’s been at the forefront of pushing equality.”\nThe conversations between Edinburgh and Paris stretch back almost 20 years, but the project became more ambitious once the Tour de France Femmes was relaunched three years ago.\nView image in fullscreen Charlotte Kool celebrates victory in the first stage of the Tour de France Femmes, from Rotterdam to the Hague, in 2024. Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/Shutterstock\n“We set out to host the Tour de France and Tour de France Femmes because we believe that live sport is a fundamental part of our country’s social fabric,” Simon Morton, director of events at UK Sport, said.\n“This will be the biggest free spectator event ever hosted in the UK, offering the public front-row access to world-class sport across villages, towns and cities.”\nThe details of the men’s race are to be confirmed but Edinburgh, Glasgow, the Lake District, Manchester, mid-Wales and south Wales are all expected to feature.\nAfter a stage finish in Cardiff, the race convoy is likely to transfer from south Wales to continue the Tour on French soil.\nIn 2014 more than 3 million spectators were estimated to have watched the men’s race as it headed to London from Leeds. That number will surely be eclipsed in 2027.\nThe 2027 Tour de France Femmes is believed to be starting in Leeds. The Tour owners, ASO, remained coy about the details of the women’s race, although Prudhomme said the women’s race may fall a little later than usual to accommodate event logistics.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You see the impact it has everywhere the Tour goes. You saw it in Yorkshire, a few years back, so it will be really special. It will give such a boost to cycling in Scotland and it gives me a lot of motivation to be there, to be part of that.”\nPete Ellen, who runs the Cycling Academy for elite young Scottish road cyclists and who rides with the Edinburgh Road Club, one of the country’s largest, said the arrival of the Tour was “brilliant” for cycling in Scotland.\n“It’s incredibly well run, and they’re really good at getting community involvement,” he said. “It will get more people on their bicycles, riding around and having fun. The more people who are riding their bikes the better the world will be. It’s as simple as that.”\nThe Aberaeron-born Josh Tarling, who is racing with Ineos Grenadiers, said the news that the 2027 Tour would visit Wales was “a proud moment”.\nThe intention to bid for the Tour, as part of a £30m package for major events first announced in Rishi Sunak’s autumn budget in 2021, originally targeted a Grand Départ in 2026, but next year’s Tour will start in Barcelona.\nFurther details of all the stages are expected to be announced in the autumn.",

      "content_en": "From 6d ago 11.43 EDT Starmer's failure to defend new Pip eligibility rules at PMQs show why 'cruel' plans should be dropped, Labour MP says The Labour MP Richard Burgon has said that Keir Starmer’s failure to answer in detail a question about how the Pip (personal independence payment) entitlement rules will work under the reforms announced yesterday shows why the plans should be dropped. In a post on social media, Burgon said: The prime minister was unable to answer a simple question today about why a disabled person who needs help to eat, wash and manage toilet needs could no longer get Pip under his proposals. The government must drop this cruel proposal or it’ll face the mother of all rebellions. Burgon was referring to what happened when the SDLP MP Colum Eastwood asked Starmer to justify the new Pip rules. (See 12.54pm.) Eastwood said: A lady came to see me recently who needed help. She had a disability. It meant that her children had to help her cut up her food. They have to help her wash beneath her waist. They have to supervise her as she goes to the toilet. Under the Tory welfare system we were able to get that lady on Pip. Under the prime minister’s new proposed system, she will get zero, nothing. And after 14 years of the Tory government – and many of us wanted to see the back of them – can the prime minister answer one question – what was the point if Labour are going to do this? In response, Starmer said that lived with the impact of disability through his mother (who had Still’s disease and was in a wheelchair for much of his life) and through his brother (who had learning difficulties), but that he thought the current welfare system was “indefensible”. He did not say why Eastwood’s constituent should lose her Pip, but he said under the government’s plans “if you can never work, you must be supported and protected”. On Newsnight last night the SNP MP Kirsty Blackman made a similar point about how the new Pip rules will work. She said: If you, for example, can’t put on your own trousers, if you cannot get in and out of the shower yourself, if you are not able to go to the toilet without supervision, you still may not make the criteria [to keep getting Pip], because none of those things get you four points. Blackman was referring to the change in the eligibility rules set out in the green paper yesterday. It says: We will introduce a new eligibility requirement to ensure that only those who score a minimum of 4 points in at least one daily living activity will be eligible for the daily living component of Pip. This requirement will need to be met in addition to the existing Pip eligibility criteria. This means that people who have lower needs only in the daily living activities (scoring 3 or less for each activity) will no longer be eligible for the daily living component of Pip. Meanwhile, people with a higher level of functional need in at least one activity – for example, people who are unable to complete activities at all, or who require more help from others to complete them – will still receive Pip. Pip works on a points system, where points are awarded by level of disability in relation to various activities. There is a guide to the points here. Share\n5d ago 13.15 EDT Hancock dismisses criticism of 'VIP lane' for PPE procurement during Covid crisis as 'wholly naive' Matt Hancock has described criticism of the so-called “VIP lane” that meant some PPE contract offers were prioritisied for Whitehall consideration during Covid as “wholly naive”. Giving evidence to the Covid inquiry in a hearing held as part of its PPE module, the former health secretary was asked about evidence submitted by an expert describing the “VIP lane” process as “problematic”, in part because there was “no consideration given to the risk of de facto differential treatment”. At a time when the government was desperate to acquire PPE, and inundated with offers from contractors largely unknown to Whitehall, the “VIP lane” enabled ministers to recommend offers from people who contacted them directly for priority consideration. The government defended the scheme on the grounds that final decisions were always taken by officials. But the initiative continues to be mired in controversy, not least because it was used by the Tory peer Michelle Mone to obtain contracts that are now subject to an ongoing criminal investigation. Asked about the expert’s comment criticising the scheme, Hancock replied: What I would say about that particular paragraph that you read out is that it is wholly naive as to the circumstances that we face. The point about naivety is really, really important. It’s fine having academics write papers about this stuff, and some of the academic analysis of how you could do better in a future pandemic is really, really valuable. But it can only have any value at all if you understand what it was like. You know, you weren’t there. This professor wasn’t there. But you’ve got to understand what it was like. The pressure to save lives is intense, but so is the reality that high-quality offers will come through and be sent through to senior decision makers, and you have to have a process for dealing with that. Apologising for being “impassioned” in his evidence, Hancock went on: I have been subject to enormous amounts of conspiracy theories about what went on here when, in fact, what happened was so many people working as hard as they could to save lives, and they bought more PPE as a result, and therefore people are alive who would otherwise be dead. And frankly, I’m incredibly proud of the people who themselves have felt under attack because of the way that questions have been put, which does have a material consequence on future responses to a pandemic. Hancock also said it was important to ensure that, in future, “more bureaucracy” did not get in the way of effective procurement in an equivalent crisis.

It has published this chart in an analysis.

As PA Media reports, speaking to reporters in Grangemouth, the first minister said Keir Starmer’s government wanted to enact cuts that would punish “the most vulnerable in our society”. During the general election campaign last year, Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, had told voters: “Read my lips: no austerity under Labour.” The SNP claims the benefit cuts announced yesterday, among other measures, amount to austerity – something that has been rejected by Sarwar but echoed by a senior member of his team at Holyrood, PA says. Carol Mochan, Scottish Labour’s public health spokeswoman, contradicted her boss in a social media post on the welfare cuts by saying: Austerity has never been a sustainable path to growth. We cannot balance the books on the backs of people who require benefits just to have a passable standard of living. These reforms are a mistake and should not go ahead. Swinney said he “could not fathom what the Labour Government thinks it is doing”. He added: I think it’s made a number of huge mistakes already. The winter fuel cut was a disastrous mistake for the Labour government to make. That proposal was offered to the Tories on countless occasions and they never took it. The Labour Party has taken that cut and they’ve now taken cuts to disability benefits, which even the Tories didn’t do. Swinney also said he was “not surprised” the cuts led to Neil Findlay quitting the party. (See 11.13am.) And he claimed Sarwar had broken his pre-election pledge. We now know that Anas Sarwar’s words count for absolutely nothing. This is the return to austerity that I told everybody would happen unless some of the hard realities of the public finances were addressed. Labour are interested now in returning austerity and punishing the most vulnerable in our society. What disgrace the Labour party has become.

Photograph: Michael Boyd/PA Share Updated at 13.48 EDT\n5d ago 12.27 EDT In a Guardian column Frances Ryan says the plans for cuts to sickness and disability benefits announced yesterday are “rotten with contradictions and cruelty”. Here is an extract. Even with the U-turn, the bulk of the cuts will fall on the Pip budget, despite the benefit having nothing to do with employment. Indeed, removing Pip – which is often used to pay for taxis, mobility aids and care staff – is more likely to push disabled people out of employment. Pip is also a “gateway benefit”, and ministers are yet to address whether those losing it could see their families lose vital carer’s allowance too. Meanwhile, the plan to reduce UC for the whole “unfit to work category” will hit many severely ill and disabled people who will not be protected by the new premium. Ministers say this will “incentivise” people to stay in the work-search group, as if the reason a teacher confined to bed with ME quit her job is that she’s just not incentivised enough. This is austerity dressed up as reform, where the government cuts the money disabled people need to live on in order to balance the books, while claiming it’s all being done to help them. And here is Frances’ column. These cruel benefit cuts will rob security from so many – but Labour will lose something crucial too | Frances Ryan Read more Share\n5d ago 12.15 EDT After the Commons vote where MPs removed the Lords amendment to the NICs bill exempting care homes, hospice and other health-related businesses (see 3.07pm), there were five more votes rejected Lords amendments to the bill. The government won them all with three-figure majorities. These included Lords amendments exempting small charities from the NICs increase, and firms providing transport for children with special educational needs. MPs are now debated a Tory opposition day motion urging the government to publish information about the impact the winter fuel payment cut has had on pensioner poverty. Share\n6d ago 11.43 EDT Starmer's failure to defend new Pip eligibility rules at PMQs show why 'cruel' plans should be dropped, Labour MP says The Labour MP Richard Burgon has said that Keir Starmer’s failure to answer in detail a question about how the Pip (personal independence payment) entitlement rules will work under the reforms announced yesterday shows why the plans should be dropped. In a post on social media, Burgon said: The prime minister was unable to answer a simple question today about why a disabled person who needs help to eat, wash and manage toilet needs could no longer get Pip under his proposals. The government must drop this cruel proposal or it’ll face the mother of all rebellions. Burgon was referring to what happened when the SDLP MP Colum Eastwood asked Starmer to justify the new Pip rules. (See 12.54pm.) Eastwood said: A lady came to see me recently who needed help. She had a disability. It meant that her children had to help her cut up her food. They have to help her wash beneath her waist. They have to supervise her as she goes to the toilet. Under the Tory welfare system we were able to get that lady on Pip. Under the prime minister’s new proposed system, she will get zero, nothing. And after 14 years of the Tory government – and many of us wanted to see the back of them – can the prime minister answer one question – what was the point if Labour are going to do this? In response, Starmer said that lived with the impact of disability through his mother (who had Still’s disease and was in a wheelchair for much of his life) and through his brother (who had learning difficulties), but that he thought the current welfare system was “indefensible”. He did not say why Eastwood’s constituent should lose her Pip, but he said under the government’s plans “if you can never work, you must be supported and protected”. On Newsnight last night the SNP MP Kirsty Blackman made a similar point about how the new Pip rules will work. She said: If you, for example, can’t put on your own trousers, if you cannot get in and out of the shower yourself, if you are not able to go to the toilet without supervision, you still may not make the criteria [to keep getting Pip], because none of those things get you four points. Blackman was referring to the change in the eligibility rules set out in the green paper yesterday. It says: We will introduce a new eligibility requirement to ensure that only those who score a minimum of 4 points in at least one daily living activity will be eligible for the daily living component of Pip. This requirement will need to be met in addition to the existing Pip eligibility criteria. This means that people who have lower needs only in the daily living activities (scoring 3 or less for each activity) will no longer be eligible for the daily living component of Pip. Meanwhile, people with a higher level of functional need in at least one activity – for example, people who are unable to complete activities at all, or who require more help from others to complete them – will still receive Pip. Pip works on a points system, where points are awarded by level of disability in relation to various activities. There is a guide to the points here. Share\n6d ago 11.22 EDT Commenting on the first vote on the Lords amendment to the NICs bill (see 3.07pm), Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader and Treasury spokesperson, said: Labour MPs today have voted for a health tax on GPs, dentists, pharmacies, hospices and care homes, and it is patients who will pay the price. The Liberal Democrats are proud we have led the fight to exempt health and care providers from this misguided tax hike, and we will not give up now. On April 6 worried social care providers and GP surgeries are going to be hit with bills they simply cannot afford. Rachel Reeves must finally see sense, U-turn on this disastrous policy and exempt health and care providers from this damaging jobs tax. Share\n6d ago 11.07 EDT MPs vote to reject Lords amendment exempting hospices and care homes from employer NICs rise MPs have voted to reject a Lords amendment to the national insurance contributions (NICs) bill that would have exempted hospices, care homes, pharmacies and dentist from the increase in employer NICs announced in last years’ budget. The government won by 307 votes to 182 – a majority of 125. Defending the proposal to reject the amendment, James Murray, a Treasury minister, said that if the government did not get this income, other tax rises, cuts, or borrowing would be needed. He told MPs: We have had to take difficult but necessary decisions to repair the public finances and rebuild our public services … In order to restore fiscal responsibility and get public services back on their feet, we needed to raise revenue including through the measures that this Bill will introduce and many of the amendments from the other place put at risk the funding that this Bill seeks to raise. So let me be clear, to support these amendments is also to support higher borrowing, lower spending or other tax rises. But the Conservative MP Wendy Morton accused the government of “giving with one hand but taking away with the other”. She said: The hospice sector is just one example of many sectors which have been adversely affected by this cruel tax that the government is placing on them. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said the Lords had made 21 amendments to the government’s original bill. “Taken together they provide protections for health and care providers, for small charities with an annual revenue of less than £1 million, for transport providers for children with special educational needs and disabilities, for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees,” she said.

PA says: Views are being sought over the move from victims, survivors and the public on what the day would be called, ways for victims to be commemorated and a date for the event. A 12-week consultation launched today comes after survivors of terror attacks have campaigned for more recognition and support for those affected by atrocities. The government has also announced plans to set up a new support hub to help victims in the immediate and long-term aftermath of terror attacks. Security minister Dan Jarvis said: “The impact of a terrorist attack is long-lasting and evolving. Victims and survivors of terrorism need the highest levels of support to recover and rebuild their lives. These reforms will significantly enhance the support available to those affected.

She has previously said she wouldn’t extend freeze on the income tax threshold - this hasn’t been ruled out but it would be at autumn budget. Tories have suggested govt is planning move for next week. Share Updated at 09.58 EDT\n6d ago 09.53 EDT Starmer declines to repeat at PMQs Reeves' pledge not to extend income tax threshold freeze Here is the PA Media news story from PMQs. Keir Starmer failed to repeat the chancellor’s commitment not to extend the freeze on income tax, ahead of next week’s spring statement. Kemi Badenoch pressed the prime minister to reaffirm the pledge during PMQs. In the autumn budget, Rachel Reeves decided not to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax. Thresholds were initially frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028. In the Commons, the Conservative leader also accused Starmer of digging his own black hole and urged him to protect hospices from national insurance increases. Badenoch said: “The chancellor promised a once-in-a-parliament budget that she would not come back for more. And in that budget, she said there will be no extension of the freeze in income tax thresholds. Ahead of the emergency budget, will he repeat the commitment that she made?” Starmer replied: “She’s got such pre-scripted questions she can’t actually adapt them to the answers that I’m giving. I think she now calls herself a Conservative realist. Well, I’m realistic about the Conservatives. “The reality is they left open borders and she was the cheerleader. They crashed the economy, mortgages went through the roof. The NHS was left on its knees, and they hollowed out the armed forces. “This government has already delivered two million extra NHS appointments, 750 breakfast clubs, record returns of people who shouldn’t be here, and a fully-funded increase in our defence spending. That is the difference that a Labour government makes.” UPDATE: Reeves is not going to extend the income tax threshold freeze in the spring statement, the Guardian understands. See 1.57pm.

      "content_en": "There is a realistic chance that one of the UK’s largest oil refineries can be converted into a hub for green chemicals, sustainable fuels and plastics, Scotland’s first minister says.\nGrangemouth oil refinery, which is being shut down by its UK and Chinese owners PetroIneos this year with the loss of 400 jobs, could become a world leader in low carbon chemicals and green fuels, John Swinney told media on Wednesday.\nThe refinery’s closure, after 100 years of production, is expected to hit up to 2,000 jobs in the east of Scotland. Trade union leaders and policymakers see Grangemouth as a casestudy in ensuring the transition from oil and gas is fair and just.\nSwinney said workers and local businesses faced “enormous difficulties”.\n“What we have to make sure is that we manage the transition from the dependence on fossil fuels to an approach that delivers net zero,” he said. “I think it can be done at scale [and] I’m confident we can deliver those new prospects for these communities.”\nHe was speaking after the UK and Scottish governments published a report from the consultancy EY that said up to 1,200 jobs could be created by attracting low-carbon businesses to Grangemouth. However, that would be too late for workers being laid off this year.\nEY identified nine industries including plastics recycling; biorefining of chemicals from organic waste; bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel production; biomethane production from organic waste; and low-carbon hydrogen from renewable sources and ammonia.\nThose industries would require substantial investment, the report said. About £3.5bn would be needed to create about 800 jobs over the next decade. As much as £7.5bn could be spent if those businesses expanded, to create 1,200 jobs by 2040.\nEarlier in March Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced £200m in UK government funding to help support five green businesses at Grangemouth; the Scottish government has put up £25m for a just transition fund.\nMichael Shanks, the UK government’s energy minister, chaired a local taskforce meeting with Gillian Martin, the Scottish government’s net zero secretary, on Wednesday morning. “We are committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth,” he said.\nEnergy analysts and environment campaigners are sceptical about some of these technologies, in particular mass production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, because they believe the costs and energy involved greatly outweigh the gains.\nBut Mark Simmers, chief executive of Celtic Renewables, a Grangemouth-based firm where Swinney launched the report, which is already making green chemicals, said he believed the plans were realistic.\nHis firm, which makes acetone, butanol and ethanol by fermenting whisky byproducts, waste potatoes and molasses, hopes to build a plant eight to 10 times larger than its current factory at the refinery site. Its products help make nail varnish, paints, medicines and household cleaning products, replacing crude oil-based chemicals.\n“We’ve got this great facility with a range of utilities, land and a lot of resources from a feed stocks perspective, but also from a people perspective,” Simmers said. “So repurposing that for a low carbon manufacturing complex, I think is a great and a realisable plan.”\nThe investment agency Scottish Enterprise would oversee possible investments, Swinney said. “This is going to take time. It’s going to take investment, and it’s going to take commitment, but the Scottish government is here for the long haul,” he said.",

      "content_en": "A Scottish judge has ruled that the deaths of three babies during childbirth could “realistically” have been avoided if maternity staff had been correctly trained.\nSheriff Principal Aisha Anwar KC said hospitals across Scotland should introduce a “trigger list” of early labour warning signs that would immediately lead to women being called in for hospital assessment.\nHospitals should also have a digital register and critical alert system for mothers who had previously had pre-term labour problems, a dedicated “red phone” in maternity units for emergency calls from ambulance crews, and improved handling of potentially difficult births.\nHer 11 recommendations followed a fatal accident inquiry, a Scottish process similar to an inquest but only called in particular cases, into the deaths of three babies in two hospitals in Lanarkshire in 2019 and 2021.\nThe circumstances of each death were different except that in all three, warning signs of a pre-term or difficult birth were not immediately acted on by hospital staff working for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\nThe first involved Leo Lamont, who died two hours after birth in February 2019 after being born very prematurely. His mother had complained to the hospital of severe back pains but was told to take paracetamol; soon afterwards she gave birth in the bathroom at home.\nThree weeks later, Ellie McCormick died from oxygen starvation five hours after birth at a different hospital. Her mother told the ward by phone she was experiencing contractions; she was advised to take painkillers and call back if her waters broke or she was not coping.\nThree hours later she called, and was admitted to hospital for an emergency caesarean when staff found Ellie had a slow heart rate. The baby did not survive.\nIn the third case, in July 2021, Mira-Belle Bosch died 12 hours after birth owing to brain injuries from lack of oxygen during birth. Her mother had reported contractions and that her waters had broken three days earlier.\nShe said she was comfortable at home but two days later, her baby’s feet were presenting. Paramedics were unable to deliver the baby and it took them five attempts to reach the hospital maternity unit by phone. Mira-Belle was born in hospital but was unresponsive; her ventilator was switched off two days later.\nAnwar said: “The death of a child is an unimaginable and deeply painful event in an parent’s life, one from which it is undoubtedly difficult to recover.\n“The purpose of this inquiry is to understand what happened and what might be done in future to avoid such tragedy. I again offer my deepest condolences to the parents of Leo, Ellie and Mira-Belle.\n“Each gave evidence with great dignity and sought to assist the inquiry notwithstanding the anguish and heartache each has suffered.”\nIn a statement, the McCormick family said they could not have imagined the individual and system failures the inquiry brought to light.\n“What seemed to be flaws with the electronic system of record keeping actually turned out to be a catalogue of errors with numerous opportunities to avoid the tragic outcome that followed,” they said.\n“It was extremely difficult for the family to hear the evidence and reading the determination is bittersweet in terms of achieving some sense of closure but also learning once again how different things ought to have been.”",

They are people who have had, throughout their lives, really difficult experiences with conventional health services, with criminal justice, and so the Thistle is trying to connect with them in a very different way.\n“They are now seeing folk who perhaps haven’t been to a medical appointment, haven’t seen anyone official for two, three years, and the Thistle is the first time that they’ve actually felt able to make an approach for help, for treatment.”\nLibby tells Michael Safi why a political stalemate between the Scottish government and Westminster meant it took a decade for Glasgow city council to open the service, and the gradual shift towards a harm reduction approach in the UK.\nAlso, Councillor Allan Casey takes Libby around the neighbourhood to see public injection sites, and explains why they are so dangerous for drug users.\nSupport the Guardian today: theguardian.com/todayinfocuspod",

Dore said: “I categorically did not tell Gina to keep her mouth shut.”\nDore told the court that Clarke had been “very protective” of Powell, treating her like “a little sister” because she was a woman working in the film industry, he knew one of her family and “wanted her to be treated with respect”.\nIt has emerged that at least five of the 15 people who were supposed to give oral evidence in support of Clarke’s claim will no longer be doing so.\nThey include the former EastEnders actor, Nabil Elouahabi, who was due to be cross-examined on Monday. The court heard he would no longer be appearing before it.\nSo far, nine witnesses have given oral evidence for Clarke, including Clarke himself. A summons to appear in court has been sent to a 10th witness Arnold Oceng, who appeared in Clarke’s films Brotherhood and Adulthood, but Millar said he was not living at his given address, nor had he responded to a WhatsApp message. The reasons for witnesses not appearing have not been disclosed in court.\nGNM’s witnesses, of whom there are 32 in total, will begin giving oral evidence on Tuesday. An application for GNM to add another witness, Anita (not her real name), was rejected by the judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, on Monday after Clarke’s legal team opposed it.\nMillar said Anita had come forward in response to media coverage of the trial.\nThe court heard that her proposed evidence included that Clarke put pressure on her to allow him to take an explicit photograph of her in a public place in Soho House, central London.\nSteyn said that while Anita’s evidence was “of some importance”, it was not critical given the other evidence available and could delay the trial.",

He said a ceasefire offer was now on the table, “Ukraine is serious about peace”, and it was now up to President Putin to decide how to respond.

Or will you drag your feet and play games, pay lip service to a ceasefire while still pummeling your prey? My warning to Mr. Putin is this – if you are serious, prove it with a full and unconditional ceasefire now. But Lammy said Putin did not seem interested in a ceasefire, and so the G7 was considering further action. If Putin does not deliver, and I must tell the house that I currently see no sign yet that he is, the G7 meeting helped us ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously. We’re not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a ceasefire, we have more cards that we can play. We can all see the impact the G7’s unprecedented sanctions have had on Russia’s faltering economy; social spending down, inflation and interest rates sky high. There can be no let up in our efforts. In Canada we discussed where we can go further to target their energy and defence sectors, further squeeze their oil revenues and use frozen Russian assets. At the same time we will keep up our support to Ukraine – Europeans clearly need to shoulder our share of this responsibility.

He said: Now it is Putin who stands in the spotlight, Putin who must answer, Putin who must choose. Are you serious, Mr Putin, about peace? Will you stop the fighting? Or will you drag your feet and play games, pay lip service to a ceasefire while still pummeling your prey? My warning to Mr. Putin is this – if you are serious, prove it with a full and unconditional ceasefire now. But Lammy said Putin did not seem interested in a ceasefire, and so the G7 was considering further action. If Putin does not deliver, and I must tell the house that I currently see no sign yet that he is, the G7 meeting helped us ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously. We’re not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a ceasefire, we have more cards that we can play. We can all see the impact the G7’s unprecedented sanctions have had on Russia’s faltering economy; social spending down, inflation and interest rates sky high. There can be no let up in our efforts. In Canada we discussed where we can go further to target their energy and defence sectors, further squeeze their oil revenues and use frozen Russian assets. At the same time we will keep up our support to Ukraine – Europeans clearly need to shoulder our share of this responsibility. Share Updated at 12.39 EDT\n17 Mar 2025 12.22 EDT The urgent question is over, but Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, is now raising a point of order. Jenrick claims that Nicholas Dakin, the justice minister, misled MPs when he said the new Sentencing Council guidelines were approved by the last government. He says that the guidelines on which the last government was consulted were not the same as the ones finally published, because new wording was added, as the council itself admitted in its recent letter. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, objects, and tells Jenrick to accuse Dakin of inadvertently misleading the house. MPs are not allowed to accuse each other of being deliberately misleading, or lying. Dakin says he doesn’t think he inadvertenly misled MPs. Share\n17 Mar 2025 12.06 EDT Justice minister Nicholas Dakin says he's 'confident' that Sentencing Council will respond to government's concerns Desmond Swayne (Con) said the Sentencing Council row showed why it was a mistake for MPs “to delegate powers to quangos which then clearly come up with solutions which we find repulsive”. Dakin says, if Swayne had been present at the meeting last week, he would not have seen it as Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, just “asking” for a new approach. He says there was a constructive exchange of views and that a “proper process” is now in place, “which I am confident will come up with the right answer”. Share\n17 Mar 2025 12.01 EDT Josh Babarinde, the Lib Dem justice spokerperson, said two-tier justice already existed in the UK. He said the country used to be run by “two-tier Tories who thought they could get away with illegal number 10 parties, while the rest of us told to stay at home”. And he described Jenrick as a two-tier Tory “who unlawfully approved a development for his donor”. Share\n17 Mar 2025 11.56 EDT Andy Slaughter, the Labour chair of the Commons justice committee, spoke out in defence of the Sentencing Council. He said the new guidelines did not require pre-sentence reports to be obtained for offenders in the designated categories, including minority ethnic people, and did not prevent judges getting pre-sentence report for other people. Dakin said Slaughter was making a good point. Share\n17 Mar 2025 11.53 EDT Responding to Jenrick, Nicholas Dakin, the justice minister, said Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, met the Sentencing Council to discuss this dispute last week. He says they had a “constructive discussion” and Mahmood agreed to set out her objections in more detail in writing. The council agreed to consider those before the guidelines came into effect. Dakin said this process should be allowed to play out. Share\n17 Mar 2025 11.49 EDT Robert Jenrick uses urgent question to call for officials who drew up new Sentencing Council guidelines to be sacked Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, is now asking a Commons urgent question about the new Sentencing Council guidelines that he claims will create “two-tier justice”. He says the guidelines, which say judges should normally ask for pre-sentence reports when certain categories of offender, including minority ethnic offenders, are being sentenced. This violates the prinicple of equality before the law, he says. He says the people who draw up the guidelines should be sacked. He says the government should back his bill allowing the government to intervene. And he says he thinks Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is refusing to do this because she secretly agrees with the plans. Share",

      "content_en": "It’s late on a Saturday night in the tiny Scottish fishing village of Ullapool, well past 1am, and bass is pulsing out into the otherwise quiet streets from a quaking function room. This is Baile/Baile, possibly the most remote regular club night in the UK.\nLocated about 60 miles northwest of Inverness, and the same distance from the very top of mainland Scotland, Ullapool has long been an important hub for the surrounding villages. Despite only having a population of around 1,500, it has plenty of art studios, cafes, galleries and a museum. Plus, it’s home to a highly regarded school for traditional arts and Gaelic language. There’s an annual book festival and, from 2005 to 2019, there was a two-day music festival called Loopallu, headlined over the years by Mumford & Sons, Franz Ferdinand and Idlewild. The village is packed over summer thanks to the North Coast 500, a 516-mile scenic driving route around the northern peripheries of Scotland.\nUllapool has a history of dance culture, too. In the 1990s, a crew threw DIY raves in the area but, with funding cuts and an ageing population, Sigi Whittle, the co-founder of Baile/Baile who grew up locally, felt it was his turn to inject some life. “I was getting frustrated that things were tapering off,” he says. “There was a gap in the market and I wanted to give something back.”\nView image in fullscreen Panoramic views … a wholesome hike. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nLaunched in November 2023 by 28-year-old Whittle and his friend Jemima Fasakin, Baile means village in Gaelic and dance in Spanish. It brings established UK artists to the Highlands while giving much-needed opportunities to local DJs. During winter, Ullapool locks down, braced for the brutal weather, so Whittle and Fasakin (a Londoner living in Glasgow) decided to host their night from November to March. “The tourists leave,” Whittle says, “and the only people left are the people living in the village.”\nIt’s not just tourists who leave: the Highlands have a hard time retaining their youth. Cultural resources get funnelled to the cities, so young people like Whittle usually move out when they turn 18. He now lives in Edinburgh, where he works as a trainee architect, but his mum still lives in Ullapool. She often allows visiting DJs to sleep at her house.\nThe Baile/Baile venue, a family-run motel and function room called the Ceilidh Place, usually hosts traditional Gaelic music events, but tonight the 100-capacity space has transformed into a nightclub. Bouncer Alan Nutu, a local, is on security with hotel manager and sound engineer Gary Craig on lights and smoke machine. “We’ve had amazing DJs,” says the later. “People coming up from down south, wondering why they’ve never been here. It’s all been really positive.”\nKen McDonald (Dulcey to his friends) has dusted off the sound system he used for throwing raves in the 90s, while Whittle and Fasakin have hired decks from a club crew in Inverness. On the lineup are DADs, the Newcastle-based breaks and UK garage duo, plus Stevie Cox and Telford, house DJs and residents at Glasgow’s Sub Club.\nView image in fullscreen Sigi Whittle and Jemima Fasakin, co-founders of Baile/Baile. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nThis is the last event of the season and by 9.30pm the venue’s already filling up. Young men in bucket hats and sunglasses punch the air as Whittle (DJ Cablecar) and Fasakin (Jemima from the Bible) play their bass-heavy opening set. It’s a mixed crowd, with fresh-faced 18-year-olds dancing alongside folk in their 60s. About half are local, the other half having travelled from Glasgow, Edinburgh and London.\nBy 11pm, the venue’s at capacity and the energy is sky-high. The crowd’s locked in – there’s nowhere else to be tonight – and they dance unselfconsciously to DADs’ break-filled selection, a far cry from inner-city club standards. When Stevie Cox and Telford play their opening house track, a woman wearing LED-flashing trainers does a little dance routine next to the decks.\nJoseph Marsh has attended every Baile/Baile since its inception. “It’s brilliant for the community,” says the 24-year-old, whose parents used to attend Dulcey’s raves in the 90s. “I’ve grown up here and there’s been nothing. I just wish it happened more often.”\nThey’ve done such a good job, they’ve had to book an entire hostel to host people who travelled up for the weekend. On Friday night, about 50 revellers descend on Ullapool, packing out the nearby pub and emptying the chippy of haddock.\nView image in fullscreen Hardy souls … a dip at Ardmair. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nOn Saturday, ravers hike up Meall Mhor, or Ullapool Hill, for panoramic views, while a few brave souls even go swimming. “It’s nice,” says Fasakin, “to have wholesomeness built into the weekend.”\nSaturday night is Baile/Baile and by 2am Stevie Cox and Telford are wrapping up their set with a techno banger. The venue is still at capacity, the punters packed in like sardines, and Whittle holds up the strobe light while Craig goes nuts with the smoke machine. When the music fades out, the crowd bursts into applause. Alan the bouncer thanks everyone as they file past, wishing them a safe journey home as they disperse into the silent village streets.",

Your article draws on the ill-will whipped up by some, but overlooks the evidence and the legacy of designation decisions made decades ago. It quotes statistics from our health check report, but what isn’t mentioned is the finding that nature decline in national parks is happening in spite of the designation, not because of it. The key conclusion of the report is that national parks need greater power and funding in the face of the global climate and biodiversity crisis.\nIn Scotland, national parks are leading the way – Cairngorms Connect is the UK’s largest habitat restoration across 600 square kilometres. And evidence from Scottish Environment Link found that the two Scottish national parks generate more than £700m per year, investing in nature, landscape and community regeneration, supporting hundreds of jobs directly and thousands through the wider economy.\nThe UK’s first national park was established in 1951 in the Peak District by a postwar government that could see the power in protecting the nation’s finest landscapes, investing in public health and wellbeing, and regenerating rural communities. The true benefit and purpose of national park designation is to create a legacy. The challenge facing a government designating new national parks is in creating the space for informed and curious debate, focusing on what unites us rather than divides us.\nDr Rose O’Neill\nChief executive, Campaign for National Parks",

The Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said that was 8C hotter than the average for the time of year.\n“We’re expecting quite a lot of dry weather, increasing amounts of sunshine as we head through the next few days,” she said. “By Wednesday, we’re looking at highs of about 17C in the south. And then on Thursday, we could get as high as 19C.”\nThat temperature is estimated to be hotter than in Ibiza, which is forecast to have highs of 17C on Thursday, while Corfu is forecast to have highs of 16C.\nHowever, the start of the week in the UK will still feel chilly, with some overnight frost, the forecaster said.\n“So the temperatures we have got currently are around average, which is about 10C. But we’ve also got quite a chilly wind at the moment, so it’s making it feel even colder,” Mitchell said.\n“But by the time we get to Wednesday and Thursday, temperatures will be about eight degrees above average in some places. The spring equinox will coincide with some nice warm weather, definitely feeling spring-like.”\nThe expected higher temperatures will be due to a large area of high pressure, which tends to bring dry and sunny weather.\nThe warmest air will be in southern parts of the UK, Mitchell said.\n“Parts of the south-east [and] across the Midlands will be the warmest spots on Wednesday, and then on Thursday that warmth travels a bit further north, so it’s going to feel pretty warm across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland and the whole of England and Wales.\n“There’s really just northern Scotland that will keep hold of the colder weather through the middle of the week.”",

      "content_en": "Edinburgh’s Royal Mile and its surrounding streets are not short of monuments. In a 30-minute round trip, visitors can rub the nose of Greyfriars Bobby, spit on the Heart of Midlothian and touch David Hume’s toe, all thought to bring good luck. On the way, they might stop for a selfie with Wojtek the Bear, an honorary member of the Polish army who went on to live in Edinburgh Zoo, while the Scott Monument, built to honour Sir Walter, looms overhead.\nAccording to campaigners, though, there is something missing: women. There are no freestanding statues of women in the city centre, and only a handful in the surrounding area. So when a fundraiser was launched in 2017 to secure a Royal Mile statue for Elsie Inglis, Scottish suffragist and maternal health pioneer, it quickly gained momentum. But when plans were finally unveiled last month, a bitter row was reignited about the choice of a male sculptor and his vision for the statue.\nThe dispute began in 2022 when the charity Statue For Elsie Inglis suddenly cancelled an open call for designs by artists for the future monument, and instead announced the appointment of Alexander Stoddart, who holds the title of the King’s Sculptor in Ordinary in Scotland and whose existing works include five statues in Edinburgh city centre, two of them – of David Hume and Adam Smith – on the Royal Mile. The backlash was so forceful that all but one of the charity’s trustees resigned.\nView image in fullscreen A sketch of the proposed monument to Dr Elsie Inglis on the southern pavement of the Royal Mile. Illustration: The City of Edinburgh Council\nAfter the official planning application was submitted a few weeks ago, opposition has continued to grow. By Friday morning, the application had amassed 163 comments from the public. Among those who have objected is Margaret Graham, Labour councillor for the proposed site, who told the Observer the design was “dowdy and not representative of the character of Elsie Inglis”. She called for further public consultation before a final decision was made.\nNatasha Phoenix, a feminist sculptor and campaigner who led opposition to Stoddart’s appointment in 2022, said the commission was “a cultural embarrassment” and should have been given to a woman. Stoddart, she said, has “no links to feminism or to Elsie Inglis”.\nPhoenix, who had planned to enter the original competition before it was closed, said: “It’s incredibly important that women’s stories are told through the female gaze. When men create sculptures of women, they often portray them through the patriarchal lens, whether intentionally or not.”\nInglis, one of the first women to graduate from Edinburgh University, founded a free hospital and milk bank for Edinburgh’s poorest women and children, and was active in the suffrage movement. When war broke out in 1914, she established a fleet of women-run field hospitals and served as a medic for three years.\nThe Inglis statue is set to be located at the site of her maternity hospital but Stoddart’s proposed design, revealed last month, depicts her in military uniform, standing upright and alone on a tall pedestal.\nPhoenix said the design “erases women’s history and lacks qualities attributed to Elsie – warmth, compassion and spirit. She existed among everyday folks and, figuratively, would never have put herself on a pedestal or above others.” Instead, Phoenix suggested, the statue should depict Inglis in a caring stance alongside a new, breastfeeding mother.\nDr Lynn McNair, a lecturer in early education at the University of Edinburgh, said she also objected and called for a child-friendly design instead of one “out of reach, physically and in representation”.\n“As a parent and educator, I’ve walked countless times up and down the High Street with a little hand tucked in mine, and I’ve seen first-hand how public art sparks children’s imagination, ignites questions and deepens their understanding of the world,” she said. “We had a chance to honour Elsie Inglis in a way that reflected her fight for women’s voices to be heard. Instead, we risk telling another story where those voices remain absent.”\nGemma Bone, a member of a Facebook group set up to campaign against the proposals, said she felt Stoddart was “an establishment male sculptor … whose agenda is to put a classical-style sculpture in a prominent place”, and that “[Inglis’s] military service, serving men, was small compared to her pioneering medical work for women and babies”.\nFor others, the issue is one of transparency. Jenny Lester, chair of Edinburgh’s International Women’s Day march, said Stoddart’s selection had been “in bad faith”.\n“For me, the problem isn’t that he’s a man but that he was selected by the trust after they said it would be a competitive process,” she added.\nAlexander Stoddart and Edinburgh council were approached for comment.\nTrustees of Statue For Elsie Inglis said in a statement that the submission of the planning application was “a significant milestone in the project to deliver a lasting tribute on the Royal Mile”.\n“The trustees continue to be committed to the delivery of this project and we hope all those who recognise the life and work of Dr Elsie Inglis will be supportive,” they said.\nBut for their opponents, the differences will be difficult to reconcile. “There are already dozens of boring, patriarchal statues on the Royal Mile that everyone walks straight past,” said one.\n“It’s an insult to Elsie and all of us to make her into another one.”\nMary Wollstonecraft\nIn 2020, Maggi Hambling’s sculpture of feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was met with criticism when it depicted her nude and as an unrecognisable “everywoman” figure. Its unveiling followed a decade-long fundraising effort by the Mary on the Green campaign, whose representatives defended the design as a modern and challenging depiction – but feminist activist Caroline Criado-Perez called it “insulting” and “a naked, perfectly formed, wet dream of a woman”.\nMillicent Fawcett\nA statue of suffragist leader Millicent Fawcett, by Turner prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing, was erected in Parliament Square after a campaign. But a few years after its unveiling in 2018, a book by professor Melissa Terras claimed the words depicted on the statue, “courage calls to courage everywhere”, had been taken out of context. Widely cited as a tribute to suffragette Emily Davison, Terras said Fawcett had not actually penned the line until years after Davison’s death, and only then to explain why her death had attracted widespread attention, rather than to celebrate her.\nVirginia Woolf\nLast year, a bust of writer Virginia Woolf in Bloomsbury was the subject of a dispute after Camden council labelled it with a QR code directing viewers to an explanation of Woolf’s “imperialist views”. The move was part of a project established in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests to “make meaningful connections between our diverse communities and Camden’s public realm,” the council said. Woolf’s great-niece Emma Woolf slammed the decision, calling Camden council “the wokerati”.",

      "content_en": "When Vishal Sharma, an experienced merchant seaman, arrived in London from India in November 2017, he was looking forward to a good job on a Belgian tanker, the MT Waasmunster, assisting engineers. He had a 15-month contract and a transit visa, enabling him to travel to Milford Haven in Wales, where the 174-metre vessel was anchored.\nBut in a last-minute change of plan, his Mumbai agent told him to head to Southwick in West Sussex, England, to board a scallop trawler, the Noordzee.\nSomething was wrong, he felt, but his agent said he would be dropped at the tanker. Sharma tried to discuss it with the captain of the Noordzee. “I told him, ‘This is not my ship. I am not a fisherman.’” He could no longer reach his agent, as there was no wifi network onboard.\n“I felt alone and afraid,” says Sharma, 32.\nAt sea, there was no easy way out. He was threatened with deportation if he did not work, he says.\n“They told me, ‘We will call the police, you don’t have the right documents, you will go to jail.’”\n“It is very dangerous work,” he says. “You can’t argue with the captain, when the ship is rolling and pitching. Anything could happen. You are at sea. It is scary.”\nI wanted to stay in the UK until I got justice Vishal Sharma\nFor the next three weeks, he worked 18 to 20 hours a day, without safety equipment or proper meals, he claims. He had little access to the bathroom and developed urinary problems, he says.\nHis ordeal ended after he was transferred on to another boat, where other migrant fishers had reported being exploited and mistreated to police. When the boat docked at Portsmouth, immigration officers were waiting and Sharma and the others were taken to a police station. “The police said to me, can you explain everything that has happened to you? They said, ‘We are with you. You are in the UK, a safe country.’”\nSharma was recognised as a victim of modern slavery by the Home Office and agreed to help police by giving evidence in a criminal case. “I wanted to stay in the UK until I got justice,” he says.\nSharma appeared on a BBC documentary, Disclosure: Slavery at Sea, which broadcast in 2024. The BBC, which also ran a radio documentary on the issue, revealed he was one of 35 men who worked on vessels owned by TN Trawlers and its sister companies, owned by the Nicholson family, and were recognised as victims of modern slavery between 2012 and 2020.\nBut justice has been elusive. TN Trawlers and its associated companies were the subject of two lengthy criminal investigations, but no cases of human trafficking or modern slavery have come to trial, although some of the men waited years to give evidence.\nThe Crown Office in Scotland acknowledges that Sharma is a victim of a crime. But the criminal investigation into what happened to him was dropped after he could not identify the perpetrators in a video.\nNow, after years of helping the authorities in Scotland, Sharma is facing deportation back to India, where he fears his life is in danger. Word got back to his agents in Mumbai that he had spoken to the police, he claims. His father was assaulted by the agents, he says, and he has received death threats. He has suffered bouts of depression.\nView image in fullscreen Vishal and Sukhdeep Sharma at home in Bradford with their son, Humraj. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer\nWhile in this legal limbo, he has built a life for himself in Bradford. He worked fitting shop fronts and married Sukhdeep, 27, a business student and Indian national. In December 2020, they had a son, Humraj.\n“She’s my wife, my best friend, she has given me moral support,” he says.\nIn a letter sent to Sharma and his family in February, the Home Office rejected their asylum claims and told them to leave the UK. It said: “It is considered that any subjective fear you may have of returning to India is not objectively well-founded.”\nJoy Gillespie, the CEO of Survivors of Human Trafficking in Scotland, an NGO that has supported many of the 35 migrant fishers who appeared on the BBC’s documentary, says: “These men have done everything they could to help make a prosecution happen. But when it doesn’t work out, they are of no value and they are left in the lurch. If we are to bring these difficult trafficking prosecutions, we have to be more victim focused and give them our support.”\nChris Williams, of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), says fishing is a “blind spot” for potential labour exploitation of migrant workers. The system ties them to one vessel, where they are at the mercy of the skipper.\n“Unfortunately, what happened to Vishal and others could happen again,” Williams says. The ITF is calling for fishers to be included in the Fair Work Agency, a new state enforcement agency being proposed in the government’s employment rights bill going through parliament.\nView image in fullscreen The BBC documentary Slavery at Sea featured migrant workers who worked on vessels owned by TN Trawlers and its sister companies. Photograph: BBC\nStephanie Hill and Carolin Ott, solicitors for Leigh Day, are investigating a number of claims for other exploited migrant fishers.\n“We are concerned that the exploitation of migrant fishers and seafarers for the purposes of forced labour and other forms of modern slavery are not being properly investigated by the police and the Home Office, who have a duty to investigate instances and risks of trafficking and forced labour,” they say.\nOn Sharma’s case, a spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service says: “The case was carefully considered and a decision was taken that we could not prosecute due to insufficient evidence. The findings of an independent review supported the original decision. Further areas of investigation were identified and are under consideration.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office says the government is determined to tackle “the scourge of modern slavery” but adds: “The right to claim asylum in the UK is an entirely separate process from the support an individual may be entitled to as a victim of modern slavery.”\nThe Guardian was told that TN Trawlers no longer exists. A legal representative of the TN group said they did not wish to comment on this article.\nLast year, a spokesperson for TN Group told the BBC it disputed suggestions that workers were mistreated or were victims of modern slavery.\nThe spokesperson said it always provided food and accommodation to workers and that they were “always free to come and go when ashore”.\n“The overwhelming experience of our workers was that they were well treated and well remunerated. We dispute many of the accounts put to us, in some cases over a decade on.\n“We absolutely refute any allegation of modern slavery or human trafficking and our many testimonials and long-term employees are testament to that.”",

Until there has been an open, professional site search with opportunity for public participation, including participation in drawing up the terms of reference and in the assessment process, planning permission\nfor the present proposal must not be granted.”\nHowever a meeting of the council’s planning committee approved the plans for the school with council leader Kelly Parry saying she was ‘delighted’ to see the school coming forward.\nAnd she addressed one objection which related to toilets in the new facility saying they were not ‘unisex’.\nShe said: “I want to clear up one issue that is the email campaign claiming there is only unisex toilets in the new Beeslack school.\n“I want to assure people that the new building will include open plan, full height, closed individual cubicles, separate toilets and accessible toilets and are therefore not unisex only. Additionally if people prefer a more private toilet facility these will be available and positioned around the school.”\nCouncillor Parry moved the approval of the plans which was seconded by Councillor Colin Cassidy.\nRecommending the plans for approval officers said: “The site is located on two sites allocated for development in the Midlothian Local Development Plan and will provide a facility that will enable the council to meet statutory education requirements.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "A ‘terrified’ 18-year-old was told to ‘drop dead’ by a taxi driver after being asked for a tip despite enduring an unpleasant trip.\nOn Thursday, the girl told South Ayrshire Council’s Regulatory Panel (Licensing) that, during the ride, she heard Dennis Nutt talk about a ‘junkie’ over the radio, believing he was talking about her. He also ignored her when she asked him to turn his music down, and didn’t reply to her when she tried to speak to him several times.\nAt the end of the journey Nutt asked the girl to give a tip, despite his behaviour and, when she didn’t, told her that he would rather take ‘a junkie, as they give a tip’.\nThe girl told councillors that after paying for her fare, Nutt’s taxi ‘spun away’ and he shouted ‘drop dead’ at her.\nShe told the panel: “After I paid him, I made sure it was the £8, they spun away and that is when they shouted out ‘drop dead’.\n“I was genuinely scared that he was going to be violent with me because of the manner of his voice and the way he was holding the card machine.\n“I thought he was going to come out and assault me. And I was alone, so I was terrified.”\nLicensing Panel Chair Councillor Alan Lamont thanked the girl for coming to speak in person.\nHe said: “When we hear it in person it always has a bigger impact.\n“I know it takes a lot to come in when you probably weren’t aware of the set up.”\nThe girl replied: “I got a bit of a fright when I came in as I wasn’t expecting it.”\nNutt did not speak at the meeting, instead leaving Richard Colville of South Ayrshire Taxi Owners Association, to represent him.\nMr Colville attempted to explain Nutt’s words and actions.\nHe firstly addressed the use of the term ‘junkie’, saying: “Dennis would like to point out that he used the term ‘junkie’, but it wasn’t directed at the customer.\n“It is a term that would be used to describe a fare. He understands that it is 2025 and we shouldn’t be using that word or term anymore.”\nHe then suggested that he had not responded to the passenger as he was using the CB radio.\nMr Colville said: “The music wasn’t overly loud because he was still communicating over that [the CB radio} and said he turned the intercom off because the passenger was on the phone and he didn’t want to be intrusive.”\nHe then said that the driver had only asked for the tip as he used a card machine that would require a transaction to be cancelled and a new one started if the passenger wanted to add a tip once the process was underway.\nA second separate complaint was levelled at Nutt, accusing him of abusive language when he called a passenger who had booked him but then took another taxi after he turned up at the wrong location.\nMr Colville said that Nutt refuted the claim of abusive language and had only made the call to tell the passenger that they would be sent a charge ‘as he felt he was entitled to it’.\nHe said that Nutt had driven past a number of potential passengers en route to pick up the complainer, losing out on fares.\nLabour Councillor Ian Cavana said “I’m a wee bit disturbed here. You’re saying that he used the word ‘junkie’ but it was only in [industry] terms.\n“But there’s only two people in that taxi at the time, so how else can the other person sitting beside the driver take it?\n“Why are you using the word junkie at all?”\nMr Colville insisted it was simply a term that taxi drivers use to describe a ‘drug run’.\nCouncillor Mark Dixon commented that he was ‘shocked’ that the operators did such business enough to warrant a ‘code word’ for it.\nCouncillor Alec Clark echoed Cllr Cavana’s criticism, saying: “It’s alright to say that it is not in reference to the girl. But, if you are the passenger and somebody says that, you will take it as a reference to you.”\nCouncillor Martin Kilbride took further issue, saying: “If they are going to ask you three times, ‘are you talking to me’, it would only be polite to respond and say ‘no, I’m on my radio’.\n“To ask for a tip. How you get tips in life is being nice to people and courteous.\n“Nobody should be under pressure asking if you are going to give a tip.”\nMrColville addressed the second complaint around the driver attending the wrong location arguing that it would have only taken a couple of minutes to go to the correct location.\nCllr Lamont pointed out that the passenger had thought the cab she got into was the correct one.\nCllr Clark said: “I don’t want to take anyone’s livelihood away, but it almost seems to me that Mr Nutt needs some anger management.\n“I would suggest that he needs to complete additional taxi and private hire training to ensure he is aware of and clear about his responsibilities as a licensing taxi driver.\n“I think he is lucky in my view not to be option two [suspension].”\nCouncillors voted unanimously to make Mr Nutt undertake a training course next week. If he does not complete the course, his licence would be suspended.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Grant Hanley vowed that Scotland will prove their doubters wrong once more by bouncing back strongly from their Nations League relegation.\nThe centre-back understood the frustration of the Tartan Army as the Scots were booed off following a humiliating 3-0 home defeat by Greece on Sunday that resulted in a 3-1 aggregate loss in the play-off and demotion to League B.\nHanley was adamant that the Scots have shown often enough during Steve Clarke’s reign, however, that they should not be written off as they build towards the 2026 World Cup qualification campaign later this year.\n“There was a good feeling in the squad after Thursday night (following the 1-0 first-leg win in Greece), but I suppose that’s football,” said Birmingham defender Hanley, reflecting on the contrasting emotions of the past week.\n“It’s not the first time I’ve had it happen in my career, where you go off a big high to a few days later having a massive low. It’s about how we deal with it and how we move on.\n“We’ve definitely had some major high moments in the last few years. There’s also been some major lows. I’m sure the squad will prove again, as it has done, that we can bounce back.\n“It’s up to us as players to react to that and to move on. This squad’s got character. I don’t think that’s something you can ever question. I’m sure we’ll bounce back.”\nScotland have qualified for two European Championships under Clarke and won promotion to Nations League A, but they have also suffered the frustration of failing to win a match at either of those two major tournaments, losing a 2022 World Cup play-off to Ukraine, and now demotion from League A.\nThe Scots lost all three of their opening matches in the top tier of the Nations League against Poland, Portugal and Croatia but then picked up seven points from their closing three fixtures against the same opponents. They continued that upturn in form with victory in Greece last Thursday before falling flat on Sunday.\n“Obviously, we wanted to end it well and we’ve not been able to do that,” said Hanley, reflecting on the campaign. “It’s ended with disappointment, but I think throughout, we were nearly there. You look at the start of the campaign, we had some good performances and not quite getting the results, and obviously, we finished it strongly.\n“We’ve been unsuccessful (in the play-off). We’ll need to learn our lessons from that, which we will, and we’ll move on.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "George Hirst hopes the bitter-sweet Greece double-header proves to be the start of a long and fruitful Scotland career as he bids to cement himself in Steve Clarke’s squad.\nThe 26-year-old Ipswich striker made his debut as a substitute in last Thursday’s 1-0 victory in Greece in the first leg of the Nations League play-off before making his Hampden Park bow off the bench in Sunday’s dismal 3-0 defeat in the return leg.\nDespite the deflating ending to his first international camp as the Scots dropped into League B, Hirst is determined to make sure he is involved in the summer friendlies against Iceland and Liechtenstein ahead of the 2026 World Cup qualification campaign.\n“It’s been an incredible week for myself, I couldn’t have enjoyed it more, to be honest,” said Hirst, reflecting on his first involvement with Scotland.\n“Bar the result (on Sunday), it’s been absolutely awesome to be a part of it and see how it works. To make my Scotland debut, it’s been absolutely massive.\n“I’m just really delighted to be here and I hope I can do enough at my club going forward to cement myself in the squad.\n“The lads have made me feel so welcome and feel so at home, so that’s been wicked. Obviously, it would have been nice to have topped it off with a result, but that wasn’t to be.

It poses a lot of challenges for us as we haven’t managed to beat Livingston this season. They’ve beaten us twice, and we drew the other.\n“So we will need to come up with something that will be a winning formula, and that’s what we have been working on.\n“We don’t have an awful lot of time between games, from Saturday to Tuesday, to work on an awful lot.\n“In the game itself, having not beaten them it opens the question how can we do that, we would really like to go there and win the game to strengthen our position at the top of the table.\n“That is our aim, to try and do that. I’m sure Livingston will have other ideas but then it is up to us to try and come up with something.\n“I can understand fans (beginning to dream of top-flight football) but we have a job to do and we are keeping our feet on the ground.\n“We have taken it one game at a time to get to this stage, so there’s no point in changing that now. We have to blank out the noise and focus on the game.\n“We have individuals who will need to be at the top of their game and collectively as a team we will need to be at our best to get something.\n“So we just need to focus on the game, blank out the noise and don’t get caught up in it. We thank the fans for their support, but we are working as they enjoy themselves and we have to make sure we get the job done.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "David Martindale admits that the Championship title and automatic promotion back to the Premiership is out of Livingston’s hands as he targets second spot.\nThe West Lothian side host league leaders Falkirk at Almondvale on Tuesday night with 11 points separating them at the summit of the second tier.\nA win for Livi, who are in third but joint on points with second-placed Ayr United and have a game in hand over the top two, would cut the gap to eight points.\nHowever, with only six games remaining after that, and five for Falkirk, Martindale believes that the title will still be heading to John McGlynn and the Bairns.\nSpeaking to STV Sport on Monday, he said: “Automatic promotion is out of our hands, so it’s just a game of football that we have to try to win and pick three points up.\n“At this moment in time automatic promotion is out of our hands, it’s with Falkirk, but we want to have any chance of finishing second we need to pick up three points tomorrow night.\n“Finishing second is within our grasp and in our hands, so we need to go and win the next game of football in-front of us and that just happens to be Falkirk.\n“It’s important we go and do that, but I still think if we win tomorrow then it remains a big ask to go and get automatic promotion from that point, because I do think it’s obviously in Falkirk’s hands.\n“So, it’s a big game and we need to focus and concentrate on ourselves. We have quite a good record against them this season, I think we’ve picked up seven and they’ve picked up one, so we come out on top on the head-to-head and hopefully we will come out on top tomorrow.”\nA win for Falkirk on Tuesday would all but secure them top-flight football next season, as they would then go into the last five games with a commanding 14-point lead.\nBut Martindale insists he isn’t putting too much thought into that as he focuses on his team and keeping up their good recent record against McGlynn’s side.\n“Realistically I think the league title is Falkirk’s to lose, so I’m not going to sit here and tell lies. Do I think automatic promotion is a realistic probability at this time? No, I don’t, even if we go and win tomorrow night it will still be extremely difficult.\n“There’s not many games left, so that makes it difficult.\n“How I’ve always worked is to focus on the next game and I don’t put too much relevance on what impact that will have on the season.\n“Our next game is Falkirk here, we have a good head-to-head ratio against them so we need to go and do that.\n“Within our grasp is second place, we have that in our hands and within our capabilities so we have to go and focus on that.\n“We know Falkirk are coming here thinking ‘we can just about secure the league title with a win’ so this game will bring different challenges and a different dynamic.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

He had shown “deep regret and remorse”.\nRazaq had been on bail, but Mr Scullion did not move for that to be continued.\nLord Mulholland deferred sentencing for reports.\nAddressing Chinenye’s family, the judge said: “I have read the victim impact statement and it is clear she was a much-loved sister and daughter.\n“She had huge potential and was working hard to fund herself through university.\n“From what I have read, she was a very talented and hard-working woman.\n“It is an utter tragedy for you.

      "content_en": "Former Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman has told the UK Covid inquiry that Scotland didn’t have a VIP lane for PPE procurement and didn’t need one.\nThe Covid public inquiry began its third week of public hearings looking into the purchase and distribution of billions of pounds’ worth of medical equipment during the pandemic on Monday.\nFreeman began her testimony by claiming there was “no evidence” of preferential treatment or bias in any of the PPE contract awards made in Scotland during the pandemic.\nShe also denied that Scotland had used the “high priority” lane procurement system used to acquire PPE contracts in England.\nIntroduced in April 2020, the idea of the VIP lane was to treat offers to supply PPE with greater urgency if they came with a recommendation from ministers, MPs, members of the House of Lords, or other senior officials.\n“We did not have a VIP lane and we did not need one,” Freeman told the inquiry on Monday.\nFreeman said she was aware the UK Foreign Office had instructed embassies to withdraw support from the Scottish Government when negotiating PPE contracts abroad.\nShe was also aware that PPE suppliers had been instructed to prioritise English healthcare settings over Scotland – even when they were contracted to supply Scottish settings.\nShe recalled meeting with the UK’s former health secretary Matt Hancock via Zoom and confronting him about the issue.\n“I did not expect Mr Hancock to say ‘you are absolutely right, that’s shocking and I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen,'” Freeman told the inquiry.\n“However, I was laying marker down to say ‘We are aware of this and we expect you to do something about it.'”\nFollowing the meeting, Freeman said she “never received a formal response” from Hancock.\n“If I’m completely frank, I never expected one,” she said.\nHowever, she “double checked” to see if the prioritisation of NHS England over Scotland still appeared to be the case, Freeman said it “appeared to have stopped”.\nFreeman was also questioned about the supposed breakdown in the link between supply and distribution for adult social care and primary care settings during the height of the pandemic.\nCounsel for the inquiry Tom Stoate asked: “Did Scotland run out of key items of PPE?”\nFreeman said: “No. We are saying we did not run out at any point; we often came close.”\nShe acknowledged there were problems with the rapidly established distribution system, but said issues were resolved as quickly as possible after it was reviewed and overhauled.\nFreeman said she didn’t believe Scotland could or should have done anything else to prepare for the pandemic procurement procedures.\n“I think for the next pandemic, we are much better placed in understanding the importance of wrapping our arms around – from the outset – all of health and social care settings regardless of the model that might exist,” she said.\nShe added that lessons had been learnt about avoiding glitches and managing systems better in the future.\nThe inquiry asked Freeman whether or not she agreed with comments made by former prime minister Boris Johnson that procurement strategies should be UK-wide.\nLike former first minister Nicola Sturgeon, Freeman said she did not agree with this.\n“If Boris Johnson means we should have single procurement route, I don’t agree with that,” Freeman said.\n“I think that removes or undercuts the necessary democratic accountability that devolution demands of a Scottish Government, and I think that is a good thing there is that accountability.”\nAsked about the UK Government’s VIP lane procurement procedures in England, Freeman said it was “not a route she would wish Scotland to take”.\n“Having a single procurement system if all parties are not equal could lead to a situation where Scottish ministers are accountable for actions over which they had no say and with which they disagreed,” Freeman said.\nHowever, she emphasised that there should be cooperation, exchange of data, and mutual aid among the four nations – which Scotland actively contributed to and benefited from, she said.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "George Clooney has said he is “not doing romantic films anymore”.\nThe Hollywood actor, 63, who has starred as the romantic lead in films including One Fine Day (1996) and Ticket To Paradise (2022), said he is “not trying to compete with 25-year-old leading men”.\nThe Kentucky-born Oscar-winner reflected on his career and his new role playing journalist Edward R Murrow in Broadway play Good Night, And Good Luck on 60 Minutes for CBS News.\n“It’s exciting to be here (on Broadway). Let’s not kid ourselves. It’s nerve-racking. And there’s a million reasons why it’s dumb to do”, he said.\n“It’s dumb to do because you’re coming out and saying, well, let’s try to get an audience to take this ride with you back to 1954.”\nPA Media George Clooney with his wife Amal (Yui Mok/PA) PA Media\nThe play depicts Murrow’s on-air showdown with Senator Joseph McCarthy who was a tireless crusader against communism, leading to a mass hysteria known as the “Second Red Scare”.\nThe production is an adaptation of his Oscar-nominated movie of the same name which Clooney directed in 2005.\nReflecting on the US government’s relationship with the press today, he said: “We’re seeing this idea of using government to scare or fine, or use corporations to make journalists smaller.\n“Governments don’t like the freedom of the press, they never have. And that goes for whether you are a conservative or a liberal or whatever side you’re on. They don’t like the press.”\nThe lifelong Democrat also discussed when he asked former president Joe Biden to step down from the race for the White House after he stumbled over his words when he faced now President Donald Trump during a televised debate.\nPA Media George Clooney arrives for the UK premiere of ‘The Tender Bar’, at the Royal Festival Hall in London during the BFI London Film Festival. Picture date: Sunday October 10, 2021. PA Media\n“I was raised to tell the truth”, he said.\n“I had seen the president up close for this fundraiser, and I was surprised.\n“And so, I feel as if there was a lot of… cowardice in my party, through all of that, and I was not proud of that, and I also believed I had to tell the truth.”\nSpeaking about his career, he added: “Look, I’m 63 years old. I’m not trying to compete with 25-year-old leading men. That’s not my job. I’m not doing romantic films anymore.”\nHe added: “There isn’t a single actor alive that wouldn’t have loved to have gone on Broadway. So that’s the fun of it. It’s tricky the older you get. But why not?”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

The alternative would have been to have only nine outfield players if we had to send a player off.”\nSchmeichel has started 46 of Celtic’s 47 competitive matches this season, with the Scottish Cup fifth-round victory over Raith Rovers last month the only one in which he has not featured.\nPA Media Kasper Schmeichel has played all bar one of Celtic’s games this term (Jane Barlow/PA) PA Media\nViljami Sinisalo, who joined from Aston Villa last summer, deputised that day and the 23-year-old Finn will be on standby in the event that Schmeichel does not recover in time for Saturday’s William Hill Premiership visit from Hearts.\nCeltic – 13 points clear at the top – have eight league games remaining as well as a Scottish Cup semi-final against St Johnstone at Hampden next month as they bid to close out a domestic treble.\nPrior to his injury, Schmeichel saved a first-half penalty from Cristiano Ronaldo but it was not enough to prevent Denmark losing the tie and, as a result, landing in Scotland’s 2026 World Cup qualification group later this year, alongside Greece and Belarus.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

EBU\nHe was taken to Sant’Eugenio Hospital with injuries to his legs and burns to 75% of his body.\nThe hospital said Mr Paterson is currently breathing with the assistance of mechanical ventilation and his condition is described as critical.\nHe has undergone surgery to remove debris from his body caused by the explosion, a spokesperson told STV News.\n“At the moment, the patient is stabilized, with the prognosis remaining critical. Further evaluations will be conducted in the next hours,” they said.\nEBU The explosion took place in the Monteverde district of Rome near Villa Doria Pamphili and destroyed the B&B the Scottish man was reportedly staying in.

EBU\n“He has suffered burns, which also suggests that this was an explosion caused by gas, which also results in flames.\n“And most likely it is the guest of an accommodation facility, on which we are also doing the maximum investigations to assess the regularity, all the investigations are ongoing.”\nThe local fire service said: “Around 9am, there was an explosion and a collapse of a two-story building in the Monteverde area.\n“The USAR (Urban Search and Rescue) firefighters pulled a man alive from the rubble.\n“The search continues to exclude the presence of other people involved.”\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has been hospitalised in Italy and are in contact with the local authorities.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "The average price of a pint of beer is set to surge past £5 for the first time due to cost hikes hitting the sector next month, according to industry bosses.\nPub sector chiefs have warned that prices for customers will have to increase in order to help keep venues running in the face of higher labour costs.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association said the average cost of a pint in the UK is expected to rise by around 21p as a result.\nThe research, commissioned alongside Frontier Economics, showed that pub firms are expecting to raise the average price of a pint from £4.80 to £5.01.\nThis comes amid a raft of cost increases linked to last October’s budget, which will come into force in April.\nFirms will face increases to the national minimum wage, a rise in national insurance rates and a decrease in the threshold at which firms start paying out national insurance.\nBusiness rates discounts for firms in the sector will also be cut from 75% to 40% from April.\nThe net cost of autumn budget announcements across the beer and pub sector is approximately £650 million in total, the trade body said.\nIt comes after historic brewer Shepherd Neame – which makes ales including Spitfire and Bishops Finger – said earlier this week that it will hike its beer prices in response to rising taxes.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said: “The cumulative impact of these taxes and regulations is now plain to see and it is highly unfortunate that the only way many pubs can remain viable is to pass on the array of upcoming costs to consumers.\n“No one wants to see the cost of an average pint increase by a further 21p and break the £5 average pint barrier that will be required for pubs to maintain their punishingly slim profit margins.\n“It is more urgent than ever that Government looks at ways to cap or reduce the costs of doing business so we can keep pubs open, preserve their community value, and make sure the price of a pint remains affordable for all.”\nTim Black, associate director at Frontier Economics, said: “The beer and pub sector has shown real resilience through a tough few years – navigating the pandemic, the energy crisis, and the cost-of-living squeeze.\n“But more headwinds are coming.\n“The sector is at the sharp end of a wave of policy changes that will push up costs – higher wages, increased national insurance, reduced business rates relief, and new packaging rules.

      "content_en": "Heathrow Airport had “enough power” from remaining substations despite Friday’s shutdown, the chief executive of National Grid has said.\nJohn Pettigrew said two substations were “always available for the distribution network companies and Heathrow to take power”.\nFlights were halted after a fire knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes on Thursday evening, and were not able to resume until Friday evening.\nIn his first comments since the disruption, Mr Pettigrew told the Financial Times: “There was no lack of capacity from the substations.\n“Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow.”\nThe chief executive of the electricity and gas utility company added: “Two substations were always available for the distribution network companies and Heathrow to take power.\n“Losing a substation is a unique event — but there were two others available.\n“So that is a level of resilience.”\nIn response to the comments, a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said: “As the National Grid’s chief executive, John Pettigrew, noted, he has never seen a transformer failure like this in his 30 years in the industry.\n“His view confirms that this was an unprecedented incident and that it would not have been possible for Heathrow to operate uninterrupted.\n“Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted. Given Heathrow’s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.”\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye had said a back-up transformer failed during the power outage, meaning systems had to be closed in accordance with safety procedures so power supplies could be restructured from two remaining substations.\nA report by consultancy firm Jacobs more than 10 years ago found a “key weakness” of Heathrow’s electricity supply was “main transmission line connections to the airport”.\nThe document, published in 2014, stated “outages could cause disruption to passenger, baggage and aircraft handling functions”, and “could require closure of areas of affected terminals or potentially the entire airport”.\nIn its appraisal of operational risk at the airport, Jacobs said provision of on-site generation and other measures to ensure resilient supply appeared “to be adequate” to enable Heathrow “to withstand and recover from interruptions to supply”.\nIt added that the airport operated “within risk parameters that are not excessive or unusual for an airport of its type”.\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered the National Energy System Operator to “urgently investigate” the power outage caused by the substation fire, and is working with Ofgem and using powers under the Energy Act to formally launch the grid operator’s investigation.\nThe National Energy System Operator (Neso) is expected to report to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and Ofgem with initial findings within six weeks.\nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police initially led the investigation, but the force said the fire is not believed to be suspicious so London Fire Brigade is now leading the probe which will focus on the electrical distribution equipment.\nMeanwhile, an internal review of the airport’s crisis management plans and its response to Friday’s power outage will be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow’s board.\nA Heathrow spokesperson said: “In line with our airline partners, our objective was to reopen as soon as safely and practically possible after the fire.\n“The emergency services and hundreds of airport colleagues worked tirelessly throughout Friday to ensure the safe reopening of the airport.\n“Their success meant that over the weekend, we were able to focus on operating a full schedule of over 2500 flights and serving over 400,000 passengers.”\nBritish Airways said it was expecting to run a “near-full schedule” on Sunday and passengers should go to the west London airport as normal unless told otherwise.\nThe airline said it operated about 90% of its scheduled flights on Saturday when Heathrow said it was “open and fully operational”.\nHeathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9 million passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024, and around 200,000 passengers were affected by Friday’s closure.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Almost half of Scottish adults would support the idea of charging university tuition fees based on the ability to pay with funding focused on those who need it most, according to a report.\nThe report, published by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland and based on polling by Ipsos UK, sought the public’s views on the value, accessibility and funding of higher education.\nThe authors said it showed widespread support for some form of help with the cost of tuition fees, but opinions were divided on the extent and scope of the kind of help offered.\nOut of the 1,057 people over the age of 18 interviewed, 44% expressed the view the Scottish Government should continue to support all first-time undergraduates, while 43% said they would prefer those whose households could afford it to pay at least some of their tuition fees.\nFour in 10 respondents (43%) agreed that too many people in Scotland continue to face barriers to going to university, with those from low-income households (65%) and disadvantaged backgrounds (55%) considered most likely to experience barriers.\nAsked where the Scottish Government should prioritise post-school education funding, 61% of respondents backed apprenticeship places, followed by grants or bursaries for low-income and disadvantaged students to cover the cost of living (50%).\nUpskilling and retraining for adults on low incomes and supporting people who face barriers to university were prioritised by 43% and 29% respectively, while just over a quarter (26%) felt that funding all first-time undergraduate tuition fees should be a priority.\nOverall, the report found almost half of Scottish adults (46%) supported the idea of charging university tuition fees based on the ability to pay, and less than a third (29%) said they would not back such a move.\nThe Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, which was established in 1901 to support individuals who faced financial barriers to access higher education, is now commissioning a Citizen Jury to consider evidence on the subject of higher education funding and make recommendations.\nIt comes at a time when universities are facing funding pressures, linked in part to falling numbers of overseas students.\nMeanwhile the Scottish Government insists it will not move away from its commitment for university tuition to remain free for Scottish students.\nCarnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland chief executive Hannah Garrow said: “We know how complex the higher education funding system is and how much rides on it.\n“However, recent discussions on how to finance higher education feel like they are stuck on repeat, while for many people funding continues to be seen as a barrier to access.\n“This research shows that there is room for a more nuanced and open discussion on priorities for funding.\n“If politicians are struggling to come up with solutions, perhaps the public can inject some democratic innovation into the debate.\n“The government has already committed to lead the development of a new funding model, so understanding the views of the public as beneficiaries and users of the system is critical.\n“We hope that the Scottish Government and all political parties in Scotland will get behind our Citizen Jury and commit to giving its outcomes careful consideration.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Donna McDonald tried Botox for the first time after being drawn in by a social media advert offering the cosmetic procedure at a bargain price.\nBut what she received turned out to be bogus.\nThe procedure left her with a huge infection and lumps on both sides of her face.\n“It was almost too good to be true, and that should have been the sign, to be honest,” Donna told STV News.\n“There was a lot of bleeding after I’d had it done, I felt blood trickling down my face during it too – then my face swelled up into a boil type thing.\n“I’m scarred for life now. There’s nothing I can do about that.”\nDonna felt embarrassed and delayed going to the GP, but she was left with no choice when her symptoms didn’t improve.\nShe added: “They suspect it’s an infection, a rare infection, and the treatment will involve months and months of antibiotics. If it’s just my face rejecting whatever has been put into it, I could possibly need steroid injections, which could lead to more scarring.\n“I also had to get blood tests done to make sure I didn’t catch HIV or hepatitis.\n“It’s unbelievable.”\nThe business of Botox and dermal fillers is booming – but concerns over safety are also increasing.\nThere is no legislation to stop unqualified individuals from administering these treatments despite Botox being a prescription-only medication.\nAs a result, there has been a surge in unregulated “Botox parties”, where alcohol and social settings blur the line between cosmetic procedures and risky behaviour.\nFor many, the cheap options seem too good to pass up, but the consequences can be life-changing.\nProfessionals working in the sector say they see cases like Donna’s on a daily basis.\nCosmetic surgeon and campaigner Dr Darren McKeown has accused ministers of turning a blind eye.\nHe said: “We know the people administering the treatments in these places have no medical qualifications. We know that very often patients are treated without seeing a prescriber, so there is no valid prescription for the medications they are being treated with, often without prescriptions, and there is no other country in Europe that allows non-healthcare professionals to perform these procedures.”\nDr McKeown believes the lack of regulation has led to an explosion of cosmetic cowboys, who are now deeply embedded in Scotland’s £400m beauty industry.\nAnd the rise of so-called Botox parties – isn’t helping.\nHe said: “No regulated healthcare professional would ever perform treatments in the context of a party setting. It’s not safe, it’s not ethical, and frankly, it’s a disgrace that it’s allowed to go on in Scotland unchallenged.”\nThe Scottish Government has recently concluded a consultation on regulating the non-surgical cosmetic procedures industry and clarifying who can and cannot carry them out.\nJenni Minto, minister for public health and women’s health, told STV News she’s seeking to put forward legislation that is both “robust” and “future proof”.\nShe said: “Every piece of legislation is a balancing act, which is why it’s so important to engage with those who are providing the services, as well as those accessing the services.\n“We have to get it right, you can’t just bring legislation in quickly – you have to have the right evidence and support.”\nAs the debate continues, the public is urged to remain vigilant when seeking cosmetic treatments.\nHealthcare Improvement Scotland has called on everyone to check whether their chosen clinic is registered and regulated to ensure their safety.\nAll private clinics, hospitals, and hospices where healthcare professionals provide services are legally required to register with the organisation.\nEddie Docherty, director of quality assurance and regulation at Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said: “Having a cosmetic treatment is a serious undertaking that should only be entered into with due consideration of the very real risks to an individual’s health and safety.\n“Bringing together the injecting of Botox, alcohol, and a party atmosphere reduces people’s judgement and their ability to properly provide consent and consider the real risks.\n“No clinic regulated by us, and run by a healthcare professional, would be permitted to run Botox parties as an appropriate environment to provide such a treatment.\n“We would urge anyone looking to get cosmetic interventions to think about their health and wellbeing, and put their care into the hands of professionals with years of appropriate training and experience behind them, and where they can trust them to make their wellbeing a priority.\n“In addition, if you are receiving Botox from a beautician, then it may be a product that has been imported from overseas and not authorised for use in the UK.\n“Only a trained and experienced healthcare professional should administer Botox, acquired through a registered pharmacist, as they can access it legally, understand the physiology of the face in order to administer it correctly, and have ready access to effective medicines if something goes wrong.”\nHe added: “People should always check that a clinic is registered with Healthcare Improvement Scotland before undertaking treatments.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Kenny McLean conceded Scotland have only themselves to blame after they threw away the chance to remain in the top tier of the Nations League.\nThe Scots were 1-0 up after the first leg of their play-off with Greece in Piraeus on Thursday, but they crashed to a 3-0 home defeat in the return match and were relegated to League B.\nSteve Clarke’s side were booed off at full-time after being unable to muster any response to falling three behind in the opening seconds of the second half.\n“The first word that comes to mind is disappointment,” said Norwich midfielder McLean.\n“I’m sure it’s the same with everybody across the country, just because we put ourselves in a decent position after the first leg and then threw it away, really, because I think we did throw it away.\n“We gave them their goals, and gave them a foothold in the game at half-time, and obviously when you start the second half the way we did, we gave ourselves a mountain to climb.\n“We then didn’t do enough to give ourselves an opportunity in the match because we didn’t really create enough.\n“They kind of controlled the game even after that, when it was 3-0. They controlled the game even when we had the ball, so we need to do more in that sense as well.”\nThe Scots went into Sunday’s second leg buoyed by a three-match winning streak and a four-game unbeaten run in which they had conceded only one goal.\nMcLean, who won his 50th cap, admitted they need to sharpen up significantly over the summer as they prepare to face Greece again in their 2026 World Cup qualification campaign later this year.\n“Especially the way we’ve been going and the way we’ve always acquitted ourselves, I think when you do put a performance in so disappointing, it does surprise you a bit,” said McLean.\n“It’s one we need to learn from, because we play Greece in the World Cup qualifiers, so we now know how good they are.\n“They are a really good team, but as I said, we gave them a lot tonight. We’ve got a couple of games in the summer (against Iceland and Liechtenstein) that we can really work together and try and get better and improve.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Scotland head coach Steve Clarke hopes there is a silver lining from their heavy home defeat by Greece after appearing to learn immediate lessons.\nClarke’s side were relegated from the top tier of the Nations League after losing 3-0 in their play-off second leg at Hampden.\nScotland had gone into the game on a high after winning 1-0 in the away leg on Thursday but they were two down on aggregate inside 46 minutes and never looked like getting back into the game.\nRyan Christie returned from suspension to replace Lewis Ferguson but Clarke otherwise kept the same team that played in Piraeus while Greece made six changes including handing a debut to 17-year-old goalscorer Konstantinos Karetsas, whose half-time introduction had inspired Greece on Thursday.\n“We didn’t have enough energy in the team,” Clarke said. “Greece had more energy. They were a little bit sharper. The best team won on the night.”\nScotland also travel to Greece in the World Cup qualifiers on November 15 and Clarke hinted he would look at making more changes before their final group game at Hampden three days later.\nWhen asked if he might have freshened things up more, Clarke said: “It’s possible. With hindsight, everything’s possible. The boys assured me they were all fit and well.\n“I think the first goal gave them a lift. Their first dangerous foray forward, they scored with that. After that, it became a long night for us. I could have done with a few more legs on the team, to be honest.\n“It might work in our favour, actually, because we have to do a similar trip in November out to Greece.\n“It may be something to look at, the fact that you go out there, you put in a big shift out there, you have the long travel back. Maybe we weren’t quite recovered in time for the game. Not everybody, but some people.\n“It’s something that I can certainly look at and try and address.”\nScotland started on the front foot with Scott McTominay looking dangerous but a lack of tracking back cost them as they conceded two first-half goals. A loose pass from Christie then gifted Greece a third.\nClarke said: “I thought the back four did reasonably OK. I was disappointed with the defending of the team. We defended as a team from back to front on Thursday night in Greece. We didn’t do that in this game and that’s why we got punished.”\nClarke added: “Greece came here and laid down a marker. We know what to expect when they come back in October. We’ll be ready.\n“To finish such a positive Nations League campaign on such a low note and such a poor performance is something that will hurt the players. We’ve got plenty of time to stew on it before our next competitive game.\n“We’ve got two friendlies in June. We have to address one or two things and try to be better going forward.”\nIt was a record fifth consecutive away win for Greece, whose starting line-up had an average age of less than 23.\nHead coach Ivan Jovanovic said: “The expectations have continued to increase but the team is continuing to meet them.\n“We have a young group of players but the future is in their hands. I feel I am fortunate to have these young players available.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",
