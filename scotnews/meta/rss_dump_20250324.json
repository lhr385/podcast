The 26-storey towers at Wyndford Road were destroyed using using controlled explosions to make way for nearly 400 new homes. An exclusion zone and temporary evacuation centre were set up as residents from 240 nearby properties were asked to leave during the operation. A fourth high-rise block will also be taken down as part of the redevelopment using a piece-by-piece demolition technique.\nThe Wyndford estate was built in the Maryhill area of the city, on the site of the old Glasgow City barracks, with the high storey blocks completed in the late 1960s. The four 26-storey blocks and several smaller high-rise buildings at one point provided homes for around 6,000 people.\nGetty Images Getty Images Crowds had gathered to watch the explosions take place Crowds had gathered to watch the explosions take place\nSome residents had campaigned against the demolition plan, arguing instead for a retrofit option. But owners Wheatley Homes housing association claimed the flats were not fit for purpose and could not feasibly be altered to meet modern floor space standards. The 600 flats in the high-rise blocks will be replaced by 386 affordable homes. The masterplan for the redevelopment includes a community hub with a hall, café, meeting rooms and computer access.\nTrisha Rankin delivered papers in the flats as a teenager.\nLocals gathered near the estate to watch the demolition, with some saying it brought back memories for them. Trisha Rankin used to carry out a paper round in the towers as a teenager and seeing the buildings torn down was \"very emotional\". She told BBC Scotland News: \"I'd start at the top and work my way down with my big bag of papers. Not every person would get them delivered but there were a lot – I'd get a lift up, start at the back of six and I'd be a few hours going up and down the stairs. \"Those flats were really good, there was a lot of lovely families in there and a lot of pensioners. Through the years they've moved on and the flats started deteriorating - it was time to bring them down.\" Ms Rankin added that the work was a \"big change\" for the entire area, Alasdair MacMahon stayed in the flats during the 1980s, and still lives locally. He said: \"There was a good community spirit there but I feel the flats have served their purpose.\"\nGetty Images The Wyndford estate was built on the site of Maryhill barracks in the 1960s\nResidents were asked to leave their homes on Sunday morning and were offered breakfast and lunch at a nearby secondary school which was used as an evacuation centre. People living within the exclusion zone were offered Tesco gift vouchers, worth £100, as compensation for the disruption. St Gregory's Catholic Church, located nearby on Kelvindale Road, had its stained glass windows covered with protective sheeting. Misting systems were being used to minimise dust after the demolition but residents had been advised to shut windows, keep pets indoors and cover fish ponds and rabbit hutches. People with respiratory conditions were also advised to avoid the area. Clean-up teams carried out street sweeping and jet washing after the explosions.\nWheatley Homes The redevelopment will see new 386 new rental homes constructed",

Reflecting on the fifth anniversary of the 2020 lockdown, Jeane Freeman said there were no \"binary\" right or wrong options - and she had to choose between harm and more harm. Asked about a controversial early decision to discharge elderly hospital patients to care homes without testing, she told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, there was not enough testing capacity at the time. But Freeman accepted that in hindsight there was room for debate on whether the decision to close schools was the correct one.\nAs health secretary in Nicola Sturgeon's government, Freeman found herself a key decision maker when the outbreak spread to the UK in March 2020. Over the next three years more than 16,000 people would die in Scotland with Covid.\nGetty Images The nationwide lockdown was announced on 23 March 2020\nFreeman said she was well aware of the potential impact that lockdown would have on individuals, businesses and health services, and she was particularly worried about the reduction in cancer screening. She said: \"There was never a binary decision in any of this. \"There was a harmful thing to do and a more harmful to do; there was a risky thing and a more risky thing.\" Freeman was asked directly about the discharge of hospital patients to care homes during the first few weeks of lockdown without a requirement for a negative test. The worst mortality rates were later seen within care homes as the virus spread among vulnerable residents, and the guidance on testing before hospital discharge did not change until 22 April. Freeman denied that in hindsight that looked like a \"crazy\" decision. \"If I could have tested every single resident going into a care home, I would have tested them - but we did not have the capacity to run those tests and process them,\" she said. She added that alternative measures were in place at the time such as isolation in order to prevent transmission of the Covid-19 virus.\nReuters Freeman said she could not say if the decision to shut schools was wrong\nFreeman said she \"absolutely\" understood the anger of those who lost loved ones. She continued: \"As I could improve the circumstances, I absolutely did, but there is no getting away from the fact that people died, people were harmed and there was a long term impact.\" But she that that if she and others had not taken those decisions, things \"would have been worse\". On the issue of school closures, which former national clinical adviser Jason Leitch has since described as something he might reconsider with hindsight, Freeman was more equivocal. \"I can't say for sure that was the wrong decision but I think it is a decision - and I think many of them are actually - worth a reconsideration,\" she said. \"There's certainly things to be done to prepare us to be in a better starting place than we were for the next pandemic - which will come along.\"\n'Running anxiety'",

Crannogs were built on artificial islands made of stone or timber in lochs. The first of these sites are believed to have appeared about 6,000 years ago in Neolithic times, but few have been recorded from the Middle Ages, which ended about 500 years ago. North of Scotland Archaeological Society (NOSAS) and Nautical Archaeology Society are to examine the potential medieval crannog in Loch Achilty, near Contin, about 20 miles (32km) north-west of Inverness.\nAndy Hickie The crannog, a type of settlement, was constructed on an artificial island\nThe small loch is in an area of birch and oak woods. The excavation later this year will be funded by Scotland's oldest antiquarian society, the 245-year-old Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Recent sampling and testing of underwater timbers already recovered from Loch Achilty by NOSAS revealed that part of the crannog was built using an oak timber dated to between 1046 and 1221, and another dated to between 1323 and1421. It said those dates suggested the crannog was constructed or modified in the medieval period.\nRichard Guest, project lead and amateur archaeologist with NOSAS, said: \"Hopefully the excavation of more timbers will lead to more dates and therefore a sequence for how the crannog was used - more specific dates of sequences could help to provide the story of who built the crannog and who used it.\" Dr Helen Spencer, head of research at the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, said crannogs contained some of the best-preserved evidence for life in the past in Scotland.",

Adam Boggon was in the United States when he found himself among thousands of passengers caught up in the chaos at Heathrow Airport after a nearby fire on Friday. Mr Boggon told BBC Scotland News he felt \"lucky\" despite the length of his trip and missing the ceremony itself, because he was there in time for the photos and wedding reception. Flights between Heathrow and Scotland's major airports have now returned to a normal service but passengers are still advised to check travel plans in advance.\nMore than 1,300 flights were disrupted on Friday after the blaze broke out, including flights to Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness airports. Among the flights affected was Mr Boggon's trip from Boston, which he discovered on Friday morning local time. A replacement trip saw him travel to New York, take an overnight flight to London, board a morning plane to Glasgow and then get driven up to Drymen, near Loch Lomond, by his parents - arriving just in time for the wedding photos being taken. His rearranged travel plans also meant an \"extra couple of train trips\" while in America. He said: \"I started in Boston at five in the morning on Friday – that flight was understandably cancelled but I got another one to New York, which flew overnight to Heathrow and then up to Glasgow, so it has taken about 29 hours. \"Just the fact I got a ticket at all for another flight was a bit of a lottery – I just happened to be near the front of the queue. \"I imagine there are a lot of people far away from where they want to be, and while I've missed the wedding I'll definitely be there for the reception, so I'm lucky.\" Mr Boggon, originally from Fife but now working in London, added that he would be taking a train to travel home after the wedding.\nEPA Flights have resumed to Scotland from Heathrow Airport\nHeathrow only reopened late on Friday afternoon, with the initial priority being flights that had been diverted away from London. By Saturday morning services from Heathrow into Scotland were once again operating regularly, with a flight from London to Aberdeen departing just after 06:30 and arriving in Scotland around 07:40. Some Edinburgh flights were cancelled throughout the morning but were expected to fly as planned throughout the afternoon. In a statement on social media Glasgow Airport said: \"We advise all passengers travelling to LHR over the next few days to check with their airline for the status of their flight before heading to the airport.\"\n'No communication'\nAmong those affected were Tartan Army football fans travelling back from watching the national team's 1-0 victory over Greece on Thursday. Shaughan McGuigan managed to get flights home via Krakow rather than his initial plan to go to London using British Airways - the airline most affected by the chaos. He told BBC Scotland News: \"It was a very tight turnaround but it was fine in the end. \"The biggest disappointment was British Airways. There was no communication from them until 11:00 and even this it was only that they could take us back on Monday, which would involve an eight hour stay at Heathrow. \"If you didn't want the flight you had to phone a number that took forever to get through, but I suspect it was a minor inconvenience compared to some.\"\nFamily handout Liz Steele missed her youngest son's graduation",

In his hometown of Dumfries, however, he is involved in a smaller venture as an owner of a little pub which is helping the local music scene to thrive. He is part of a group called To The Nines which bought the Coach and Horses on the Whitesands a couple of years ago. It has been praised by bands, music organisations and people working to revive the town centre for the boost it is giving to the south of Scotland town where the global superstar grew up.\nThe Coach and Horses on the Whitesands in Dumfries has bands playing most weekends\nHarris - whose real name is Adam Wiles - has previously shown a commitment to the area where he was raised when he offered to help out workers affected by the closure of a fish factory in Annan. He is listed under his real name as a director of To The Nines Ltd, along with his friend Mark Irving. A report in The Sun recently highlighted how he had gone back to his home town to make his investment. Title deeds show the group bought the Coach and Horses in August 2023 for £190,000 and it has continued to build on its reputation as a local music venue. The pub is one of a growing number of venues in Dumfries helping give a platform to local bands.\nHagen Patterson, director of the Dumfries Music Collective (DMC) which aims to provide musical opportunities to young people in the region, said they had always recognised the Coach and Horses as an \"iconic grassroots music venue\". \"We have witnessed some great artistry to come out of the pub over many years,\" he said. He said it could offer a \"leg up\" to local artists and it was great that such a worldwide star had helped allow it to do so. \"Performing live for the first time, even if just for a handful of listeners, provides invaluable experience,\" he said. \"It's a chance to try out brand new material, gauge reactions, and build a local fan base. \"We are delighted that Calvin and Mark have ensured the longevity of the Coach and Horses, this helps foster our scene.\"\nKissing the Flint Kissing the Flint performed at the Coach and Horses earlier this month\nKissing The Flint recently played at the pub having started gigging in Dumfries a few years ago having moved from Australia. The band's Leah Chynoweth-Tidy said the site had quickly won their hearts. \"All the staff are so supportive and welcoming, really love their live music and are super proud of their historic, vibrant wee venue, which well they should be,\" she said. \"It's always a fantastic experience playing there as the audience are open to any kind of genre and are incredibly responsive and enthusiastic about our original music, which is becoming a rarer thing these days in many venues. \"The Coach feels like coming home for us every time we play there, and all who sail in her have become part of our music family.\"\nSandy Robertson Andy McMillan said the pub owned by Calvin Harris was an \"awesome grass roots venue\"\nAndy McMillan, frontman with Dumfries three-piece the Dogz, has similar praise. \"The Coach is an awesome grassroots venue,\" he said. \"All the staff are passionate about live music and supporting local bands, whether established acts or those just cutting their teeth in front of an audience. \"It's always a top gig for us and although it's a small venue its contribution to the local music scene is huge.\"\nGetty Images Harris plays huge venues now but started out with much smaller gigs\nJust along the road from the pub, Rab Smith runs the record shop Domino Entertainment and is a former chairman of the town's retailers' association. He said he believed the area could be at the heart of boosting nightlife in Dumfries. \"The whole Whitesands could be a great entertainment centre,\" he said. \"The old tourist board building could be spectacular.\" He also said it was good to see a local boy made good like Harris putting something back into the community. \"It is a great wee pub - it is too small to be a King Tut's - but it is great that somebody is putting money into it and keeping it alive,\" he added.\nRichie Nicoll Richie Nicoll chairs Dumfries Town Board looking at ways of regenerating the town centre",

      "content_en": "40 years of Deacon Blue - and you can get our new album on cassette\n2 days ago Share Save Catherine Lyst BBC Scotland News Share Save\nBBC Deacon Blue formed in Glasgow in the 1980s\nIn 1985 Deacon Blue formed in Glasgow and over the years have achieved great success with 12 UK top 40 singles and two UK number 1 albums. Their debut album, Raintown, referring to Glasgow, spawned what is probably their most popular hit, Dignity, which is still regularly played at parties and has even been adopted by Dundee United fans. Forty years on, the band are still together - after a brief hiatus - and are releasing a new album, The Great Western Road. The album title gives a nod to the places they used to meet up for gigs back in the day and also serves as a metaphor for their lives. \"I was thinking about these big roads and avenues that lead out of Glasgow and at the time of life we're at it's this unknown ending,\" singer Ricky Ross tells BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. \"You have to think about these things so it became an interesting metaphor - the idea that you just don't know what's round the corner. It's also quite exciting.\"\nGetty Images The band began when Ross got together with drummer Dougie Vipond\nRoss, a former teacher, points out that a lot has changed in 40 years, not least the music industry, which has changed almost beyond recognition. To celebrate this, and to mark their milestone, the band are releasing a cassette version of the new album. \"That's causing people quite a lot of amusement as they can't find a cassette player,\" Ross says. The band formed in the summer of 1985 - when Ross moved from Dundee to Glasgow - taking their name from the 1977 Steely Dan song Deacon Blues. Original members included Ross, singer Lorraine McIntosh - who married Ross in 1990 - drummer Dougie Vipond, keyboard player James Prime and guitarist Graeme Kelling. \"This all started when Dougie and I got together,\" Ross adds. \"Over the last 40 years our lives have changed and things have gone in different directions for everyone but those of us who started it are very, very close. \"They are the closest people in my life. We all created something very special when we started.\"\nGetty Images The band are incorporating smaller theatre shows into their current tour\nRoss says he really appreciates the older fans who still come to the gigs but is also pleased to see younger fans in their audiences. \"I am very grateful that people are still coming – that they've come all these years to see us,\" he says. \"They are the core audience but its lovely that they've passed this on to other people as well. \"We were playing at the Albert Hall a couple of years ago – there were four guys in their early 20s and I thought 'are they taking the mickey here?' but they were for real and that was quite nice.\" The band are currently playing a string of gigs around the UK and Ireland, some of which are in smaller theatres. \"We wanted to do the new record and a lot of the songs we haven't got the chance to do when we play bigger shows,\" Ross says. \"But we're coming back later in the year – playing in Aberdeen and a couple of shows at the Hydro in Glasgow - when we'll do everything, all manner of things, which we always try to do. \"You always want to make people feel that they've got the best of you.\"",

      "content_en": "The singer selling out gigs - without releasing songs\n2 days ago Share Save Jonathan Geddes BBC News Share Save\nKerr Mercer Kerr Mercer has had lots of support from Stargazing singer Myles Smith\nHe is writing songs with Lewis Capaldi and swapping sweets with Teddy Swims, but anyone wanting to listen to rising pop star Kerr Mercer's music has a problem - because he hasn't released a song yet. The Lanarkshire singer's piano-led songs have seen him sell out gigs across the country and earn support slots with major bands. But he's decided to wait before bringing out any music so he can \"build a real fan base\". \"I just find it insane that people are wanting to come see me without any music being out,\" admits the teenager, who is from Uddingston.\nHowever, his unusual approach hasn't stopped him being backed by Lewis Capaldi, who has worked on a tune with the 18-year-old after a mutual connection in the music industry helped set up a collaboration between the two. \"Lewis has been absolutely class with me,\" he told BBC Scotland News. \"We met a few times and have now written a song together. When I was starting out I was covering his songs and now we're writing together - it's a bit mad to have people at that level interested in what I'm doing musically.\" Other than video clips shared on social media, no-one can hear Kerr's sensitive piano-led songs - a deliberate decision. \"I've seen so many artists on TikTok firing out a song a week but then not be selling out 200-capacity venues\", he explains. \"I'd rather sell out a tour than have a million streams on Spotify. One thing that'll never change is that real people want to go see gigs so I've just done lots of shows and supported folk. \"We did two headlines in Glasgow, selling out King Tut's. Then it was Saint Lukes, which is double the size of Tut's, and then a UK tour. I spoke to a few people and decided to try to push it out further with another tour.\"\nGetty Images Sam Cooke is a huge inspiration for Kerr\nThat tour will end on Sunday at the Garage in Glasgow, his biggest hometown gig yet. He jokes most of the people coming to those gigs are family members, which gently plays down his growing popularity. However, he has had plenty of family backing, taking singing and piano lessons as a child and getting a taste of the arts by appearing in pantomimes as a youngster, treading the boards at the Pavillion theatre. It came naturally to someone who admits he was \"always the class clown\" at school, and enjoyed being the centre of attention. By the age of 10 he was singing at a local song club, performing a Queen track on his first appearance. His musical roots come from the school run, however. \"I was in primary school in Uddingston and my sister was in secondary at Uddingstoon Grammar, so I had half an hour to wait before my grandad picked her up. He had a Sam Cooke record that would just play and before I knew it, I had all the words off by heart.\" That led to a love of classic soul - Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Etta James - that Kerr says is \"imprinted\" in his music to this day.\nThe Small Print PR Kerr Mercer started off playing open mic nights\nWhile he can't credit his family with blessing him with musical genes (\"there's not much music in my family other than karaoke\" he laughs) that hasn't stopped parents Kirsty and Robert offering support. And in his mum's case, some criticism... \"I could do the Brits and she'd tell me if I wasn't good,\" he says. \"As soon as I write a new song I'll send it to my mum and dad first. My dad is chill, he likes everything but me and my mum are very similar, so if I've not done my best, she'll tell me. \"I've played to thousands supporting Tom Walker and my mum was like 'you weren't at your best tonight' but then other times she goes 'that was outstanding'. \"More people are now telling me everything's going amazing but I only believe I've done well if I get the seal of approval from my mum.\"\n'Myles Smith called me a melt'\nHe has been backed by far more than his family now, having racked up support slots with a number of pop music heavyweights like Teddy Swims and Myles Smith. The advice of Stargazing singer Smith - the man with the best-selling British single in 2024 - has provided a big boost to Kerr, even if those words of wisdom are sometimes delivered tongue in cheek. \"I was home for Christmas and not sure what to do now that the tour was over. I got a message from Myles that simply read 'why don't you release a song, ya melt'. \"He's great though. It's not like the support act is always chilling with the headliner, but Myles was amazing about it. I was sitting in my dressing room and Myles burst in and was like 'why are you here, come have a beer with us' - then we would just sit talking about songs.\" He's now writing with an array of collaborators, and starting to record material with the aim of finally releasing songs later this year, adding that he's being a \"perfectionist\" about what should come out after such a wait. \"It's great fun too – you go for a day, write a song together and then go to the pub. There's not many jobs where you get put with two people you've never met, have a therapy session and then write a song about it.\"\nEPA Kerr has toured with the American rapper Teddy Swims",

Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success. There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan. \"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says. \"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.\nPA Media There is a statue to legendary football manager Bill Shankly outside Anfield\n\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\" Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus. The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book. The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced. \"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"\nPA Media Scottish football manager Bill Shankly was credited with transforming Liverpool FC into one of Europe's leading clubs.\nThe wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice. \" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says. \"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\" That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage. At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play. \"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"\nClara Mbirini In rehearsals for Red or Dead in Liverpool which opens on Friday night\nBorn in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\". He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow. He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give. After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor. He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\nGetty Images Mullan has worked steadily in film and television, including recent Amazon Prime blockbuster series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\nMore recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party. Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry. \"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea. \"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\" He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty). \"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"\nGetty Images As a director, Mullan picked up a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for The Magdalene Sisters\nNormal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team. Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football. \"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\" It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive. \"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein – those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much. Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism? \"There's Alex Ferguson, who has lived to a ripe old age, but he's in the same camp. The last of those committed, nothing-else-but-football managers. They live and breathe it.\"\nGetty Images Mullan says Red or Dead is as much about fanaticism as it is about football",

Moving out from under the Branchform shadow\n3 days ago Share Save Philip Sim Political correspondent Share Save\nGetty Images John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon are close politically and personally\nNicola Sturgeon understandably says she's relieved to no longer be the focus of a police investigation. That feeling will be shared by many in the SNP. This has been a damaging period for the party and one that senior figures accept contributed to its collapse in last year's general election. Ms Sturgeon says she's ready to move on with her life - but will her party be able to do likewise and rebuild its political fortunes?\nShe described Operation Branchform as a cloud which has been hanging over her for years and that is absolutely the case for her party too. It is still a difficult day - the Crown is pressing ahead with charges of embezzlement against her husband Peter Murrell, a man who was critical to the running of the SNP for 20 years. As chief executive, he played a key role in transforming it into an election-winning machine. But he is not a household name the way Ms Sturgeon is. She's arguably the most famous woman in Scotland, indelibly linked to her party.\nGetty Images Humza Yousaf's time as first minister was overshadowed by the Operation Branchform investigation\nMs Sturgeon resigned in February 2023 and the Branchform investigation unfolded rapidly while Humza Yousaf was trying to get his feet under the table as her successor. It felt as though every time he was lining up an event or a statement to set out his leadership there would be a fresh development in Operation Branchform. That meant the public was largely introduced to Mr Yousaf as the man being doorstepped by reporters, saying things like \"of course I'm surprised one of my colleagues has been arrested\". The \"optics\" were also frankly disastrous when it came to a blue police tent being set up outside the home of Mr Murrell and Ms Sturgeon, and officers carrying stacks of boxes out of the party's HQ.\nThe police, incidentally, will forever defend the decision to deploy that famous tent. With the suburban street jammed with photographers and camera crews, they feel they had a duty to shield their sensitive work from view. In any case, senior figures in the party acknowledge that the investigation was a contributing factor to the huge losses they suffered in the 2024 general election. Mr Yousaf's self-inflicted exit from office, via a row with the Greens, was another. And then there was the UK-wide context of Labour sweeping the Tories from office. But these have also provided the chance for a clean break under John Swinney.\nGetty Images John Swinney had been leader of the SNP for barely two months when the party lost 39 seats compared to 2019 at the 2024 general election\nHe was extremely close politically and personally to Ms Sturgeon. As both SNP leader and first minister, he will hope Thursday's news is a chance to move on. He has already begun to rebuild the SNP's position in the polls, helped by Labour's struggles in adapting to government at Westminster. It has helped that he has not been dogged by daily updates from Operation Branchform the way his predecessor was. Mr Swinney has had a clearer shot at setting the agenda on his own terms. He's now hoping to head into the 2026 Scottish election campaign without constant questions about police inquiries. Ms Sturgeon is not even a candidate. And while being very careful of the legalities, he's also starting to reframe this from something which potentially, allegedly, happened within the SNP to something which potentially, allegedly, happened to it. The SNP has, in its decades in power, proved to be a master of reinvention. From a group happy to do budget deals with the Tories under Alex Salmond, to one allied with lefty Greens under Ms Sturgeon. Mr Swinney will hope he can craft yet another new - post-Sturgeon - identity, in order to retain power next year.\nGetty Images Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell were together at the centre of both the SNP and Scottish public life",

      "content_en": "What will the Tour de France mean for Edinburgh?\n4 days ago Share Save Craig Williams BBC Scotland News Share Save\nGetty Images The Cycling Tour of Britain visited Edinburgh in 2015\nThe announcement that the world's biggest cycle race will visit Scotland in 2027 is good news for fans of the sport. Cyclists taking part in the 114th edition of the Tour de France will set off from Edinburgh, with the start of the women's race - the Tour de France Femmes - to begin at a different UK location which has still to be announced. It is the first time both the men's and women's \"Grand Départs\" will be held in the same country. A full schedule for the event will be revealed in the autumn. Scotland, England and Wales will share six stages of the cycling event: three each for the men's and women's races.\nOrganisers will be hoping the Tour brings crowds of supporters as well as major economic and social benefits to the capital when the cyclists speed through in July 2027.\nWhy is the Tour coming to Edinburgh?\nThe men's version of the world's most famous cycling race has come to the UK four times before, in 1974, 1994, 2007 and 2014. These occasional appearances have proved very popular. Crowds at the roadside for the three English stages in 2014 were estimated at almost five million. What's new in 2027 is this will be the first time both the men's and women's events have come to the same nation in the same year. And it is the first time the Tour is coming to Scotland. The decision to bring the Tour to Edinburgh builds on a number of recent cycling events in Scotland, including the inaugural UCI Cycling World Championships in 2023. That saw more than a million spectators turning out over 11 days of action. And of course, Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games. They will be back in the city in 2026.\nWhat will the public be able to see?\nThe great thing about the Tour is it is free. As with similar events, including the annual Tour of Britain, nobody will have to pay to see the cyclists, you will simply have to turn up and grab a space on the route. Be warned, though, cycling fans are devoted to their sport and if you want a spot by the side of the road you will have to be prepared to get there early. The last time the Tour came to Britain there was enormous interest, with more than two million people coming out to watch. Cities and towns along the route saw crowds waiting patiently for the pelaton - the main group of riders - to pass.\nWhat benefits are there from hosting the Tour?\nPA Media The 2014 Tour started in Leeds and visited other parts of Yorkshire including Haworth\nA study of the economic and social impacts of hosting the Tour in Yorkshire in 2014 concluded that there were a number of major benefits from the two-day event, including: 2.3m visitors to the region.\n200,000 people visiting York.\nA £102.3m positive economic impact for Yorkshire.\n£8.3m economic boost for York.\n£7m spend from visitors to York.\n52% of attendees said they felt inspired to cycle more.\nA high interest in the event and the sport from younger people. A decade on, the legacy of that weekend appeared to be positive. There was even an annual cycling race set up - dubbed the Tour De Yorkshire - though that was cancelled after five years over funding issues and the effects of the Covid pandemic. Edinburgh will certainly hope for some of these positive outcomes when it hosts the 2027 event. Rob Dickson, director of industry and events at VisitScotland, said: \"The announcement that the Tour de France is coming to the UK, with Edinburgh set to host the prestigious Grand Départ in 2027, is fantastic news. \"As a world-class destination for tourism and events, Scotland's breathtaking landscapes, iconic venues, and rich history make it the perfect stage for the world's most famous bike race. \"With our renowned hospitality and passion for major events, we look forward to welcoming athletes and fans from around the globe. Major events like this not only showcase Scotland's stunning scenery but also inspire visitors to experience the thrill of cycling here for themselves.\" The 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships was credited with bringing \"significant economic benefits\" to Scotland, including more than £205m of economic activity and the equivalent of 5,285 jobs created over a year. An independent assessment credited the event with contributing to a \"more sustainable society\" in terms of promoting inclusion and accessibility and encouraging active travel.\nWill it turn Scots into cyclists?\nPA Media Retired Tour cyclist Mark Cavendish helped launch the 2027 event at Edinburgh Castle on Wednesday\nThat's certainly the hope of those who manage and promote the sport in Scotland. Speaking at the announcement on Wednesday, Scottish Cycling chief executive Nick Rennie said it was \"hard to underestimate\" the scale of the announcement and the impact it would have on cycling in Scotland. \"For the Tour de France to not only visit, but start in Scotland, is a huge milestone, not only for cycling but for sport in Scotland,\" he said. \"Over the last decade, Scotland has continued to build a reputation as an outstanding major event host, with the 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships further enhancing this. \"What that event 18 months ago did was raise people's awareness of the different types of cycling available, and that cycling is truly for everyone. \"With the Commonwealth Games returning to Glasgow next summer, and the Tour de France Grand Depart taking place in Edinburgh 12 months later, we really are in a golden era for cycling in Scotland.\"\nCyclist and bike-seller Dougal Brown is excited by the Tour announcement",

The box - containing 49 pieces of coloured glass - was delivered to 950-year-old Dunfermline Abbey in November 2020. There was also a typewritten note explaining how the glass was in a pile outside the building and the person had felt \"a bit guilty\" about taking it. Experts have now used a variety of techniques, including studying the materials used to make the glass, to show they originated from the abbey's Margaret Window.\nSolving the mystery had been complicated by the fact that all 10 of the site's stained glass windows were fully intact when the parcel arrived in 2020. Experts now believe the fragments were left on the ground after part of the window was accidently broken in the 1990s.\nPA Media The box arrived at the abbey in 2020\nPA Media A note was found with the glass, which had been wrapped in newspaper\nThe box arrived marked for the attention of Bob Brewse - believed to be a play on the name of King Robert Bruce, whose remains are buried at the abbey. The accompanying note said: \"Hello there, I am returning some stained glass that I found over 20 years ago. \"It was in a small pile below the scaffold that was erected by the Abbey (near footpath facing west.)\" The note went on: \"I wrapped it up in paper to protect it but never had the chance to return it. Unsure if it was new glass going in or old coming out. \"I felt a bit guilty taking it and hope it will get used. Regards, CEEPS.\" The identity of Ceeps remains a mystery.\nPA Media Experts said the glass was from the Margaret Window\nExperts from the University of Stirling, Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and Glasgow School of Art uncovered clues about the glass. They studied kirk session records going back to the 1980s to find mention of damage and repairs. The glass was analysed and it was found to contain lead, potassium, arsenic and sulphur, materials used to make stained glass between the 1870s and 1930s. The Margaret Window was made in 1932 and designed by Edinburgh artist Alexander Strachan.\nPA Media The remains of Robert Bruce are buried at Dunfermline Abbey\nIt depicts the marriage of Queen Margaret and King Malcolm Canmore in Dunfermline in 1069. Vivienne Kelly, a PhD student involved in the research, said the window may have been accidently damaged by a scaffolding pole during refurbishment work in the late 1990s. Parish minister Rev Dr MaryAnn Rennie said: \"We are delighted that the mystery of where this glass originally came from has finally been unravelled. \"We still have no idea who Ceeps is and why they decided to return it to the abbey when they did, but we are grateful.\"\nMembers of the public can see the glass fragments at an exhibition at Dunfermline Carnegie Library & Galleries examining the role of the church in the local community and its history. People can take the opportunity to make known their views on the future of the building. Earlier this year, the Abbey Church revealed it was facing £8 million upgrade costs. The Abbey Church does not receive public funding and the burden of paying for repairs and improvements falls on the 425-member strong congregation. The congregation has set up an online fundraising page where people can donate money.",

There were no bars on the windows, no barbed wire, no high walls. This did not feel or look like any prison I had visited before. Inside it felt warm and looked welcoming in pinky pastel colours. The reception seemed so friendly that I did not even notice the body scanner. The Lilias Centre, in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, is part of a multimillion-pound experiment to tackle reoffending through rehabilitation. It is one of two community custody units – along with its sister unit, Bella in Dundee – which have been created in Scotland. They give female inmates greater freedoms than traditional prisons and prepare them for life in the community after their sentence.\nKristie Clelland says the services should be equal for everybody\nKristie Clelland, who has 30 years' experience in the prison service, is aware that some people see Lilias as a soft touch approach. \"There is no doubt the facilities here are very good,\" she says. \"We could say that services should be good and equal for everybody. \"Our job in the prison service is not to punish, their punishment is their loss of liberty. \"If we can have an environment where they feel that they are supported and they are ready to go back into the workplace or go back to their homes as better citizens or people who are ready to integrate fully as citizens... that to me is a good thing.\" And is the approach working? \"Time will tell,\" Kristie says. \"If we can have women that leave here feeling a sense of hope, feeling that they have achieved something and have maybe learned a new skill or feeling a little bit more confident in themselves, that is success for some people.\"\nThe Lilias Centre is located in the Maryhill area of Glasgow\nRona Mackenzie is serving a life sentence for murder. The 62-year-old has spent more than 15 years in prison and is due to be considered for parole later this year. She moved to Lilias just before Christmas in 2023. \"Fifteen years in closed conditions, that was hard,\" she says. \"And you come to Lilias and it's great.\" She says the unit is like running your own household. \"You cook your own food, you eat what you want, you buy what you want,\" she says. \"You sit with an officer and you do your shopping and you choose what you want to eat, which is great. \"You do your own washing.\" Rona says you can't pick your neighbours, but she's been lucky and gets on with everyone. \"They look at me as the mother hen,\" she says.\nScottish Prison Service Rona Mackenzie has spent more than 15 years in prison\nHowever, Rona - who was sentenced to life in prison for murdering a woman she ran over in her car - does not downplay the seriousness of her crime. \"I have remorse every day for what happened that day,\" she says. \"It took me a long time. I punished myself every day for a long long time in prison. \"I took somebody's life in a split 13 seconds, left three kids without a mother.\" She says finding a church fellowship has been great for her. \"I've opened up and I've been honest,\" she says. \"I've spoken about my crime. I can't change it. I wish I could, but I can't.\" Lilias is helping Rona to prepare for life back in the community. She has a work placement two days a week at a foodbank, which has allowed her to see how much life has changed while she has been in jail. \"I was quite shocked when I took my first bus journey and everybody's on phones. \"Buses were busy, streets were busy - but that's life, isn't it.\"\nShe says the experience has made her more confident about facing the world outside prison. \"It is years since I've done things like that,\" she says. \"Everything is just different.\" She is looking forward to her release but admits to being frightened about what comes next. \"To say I'm not scared would be a lie, but I know God will make a way for me,\" she says.

No further police investigation is taking place into Nicola Sturgeon, who was married to Mr Murrell, or former SNP treasurer Colin Beattie, both of whom were earlier arrested and questioned. Here are some of the key dates from the long-running controversy and police probe into the party's finances. September 2014 - A referendum is held in which Scottish voters reject Scotland becoming an independent country by a margin of 55% to 45%. The SNP leader and first minister Alex Salmond decides to resign and is later replaced, uncontested, by his deputy Nicola Sturgeon. May 2015 - The SNP secures a landslide win in a UK-wide general election, securing 56 of 59 seats in Scotland and 50% of votes cast north of the border. Scottish Labour is left with just one MP. June 2016 - Voters across UK vote to leave the European Union by 52% to 48%, but in Scotland 62% of voters want to remain in the EU. Ms Sturgeon declares that Scotland is being taken out of the EU against its will, something she regards as \"democratically unacceptable\". March 2017 - Ms Sturgeon announces plans for a second independence referendum. On the same day, the SNP launches the #ScotRef fundraising appeal for the campaign.\nref.scot The SNP launched a fundraising appeal on the day Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for indyref2\nJune 2017 - A UK-wide general election sees the SNP's share of the vote in Scotland fall from 50% to 37%. The #ScotRef crowdfunder is closed down early, having raised nearly half its £1m target. December 2019 - The SNP make big gains in another general election, securing 45% of the vote in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon says voters have sent a \"clear message\" on a second independence referendum. A second fundraising website yes.scot helps take the indyref2 fighting fund total to nearly £667,000. SNP membership peaks at nearly 126,000 in 2019 - about 100,000 higher than at the time of the 2014 independence referendum. But the following year, the party's accounts reveal it has fallen back to about 104,000.\nPA Media Pro-independence blogger Stuart Campbell used his Wings Over Scotland website to invite donors to ask questions\nOctober 2020 - Pro-independence blogger Stuart Campbell, the man behind the Wings Over Scotland political website, highlights that according to the SNP's 2019 accounts it only has £97,000 in its bank account and total net assets of £272,000. The article \"You've Been Robbed\" invites donors who are \"concerned about this state of affairs\" to ask the SNP what has happened to their donations. March 2021 - Three SNP officials - Edinburgh Lord Provost Frank Ross, Allison Graham and Cynthia Guthrie - resign from the party's finance and audit committee after being denied sight of the accounts. A statement from them is read out at an SNP NEC meeting, the party's ruling body. Ms Guthrie later joins the newly-launched Alba party led by Alex Salmond. A video, which emerged in 2023, apparently shows Nicola Sturgeon telling this NEC meeting that the party's finances have never been stronger, and warning of the impact on future donations if anyone goes public with their concerns. A few days later Police Scotland receives its first complaint, widely reported to be from pro-independence activist Sean Clerkin, about the SNP's finances. Several other complaints are subsequently said to have been submitted.\nSturgeon plays down SNP finance fears in leaked video\n6 May 2021 - The SNP wins 64 seats in the Scottish Parliament election, one short of an outright majority. Nicola Sturgeon hails it as a \"historic and extraordinary\" fourth consecutive victory for her party. While the Covid pandemic is her priority, she says she still intends to hold an independence referendum once the crisis has passed. 29 May 2021 - MP Douglas Chapman resigns as SNP national treasurer, saying he has not \"received the support of financial information required to carry out the fiduciary duties\". He had only been in the job since the previous November, when he defeated long-serving treasurer Colin Beattie in an internal vote. SNP deputy leader John Swinney tells the BBC he does not understand why Mr Chapman quit and he has no knowledge of any police investigation. A few days later, SNP MP Joanna Cherry also resigns her position on the NEC, citing concerns over \"transparency\" and Mr Beattie is reappointed as the party's treasurer.\nJohn Swinney: 'I don't understand' why the SNP national treasurer quit\nJune 2021 - SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, the husband of Nicola Sturgeon, provides a £107,000 loan the party to \"assist with cashflow\". July 2021 - Police Scotland formally launches Operation Branchform, an investigation looking into the complaints about the SNP's finances. September 2022 - The SNP's longstanding accountants Johnston Carmichael resign from their role as auditors, but the news does not emerge until seven months later. 15 February 2023 - Nicola Sturgeon unexpectedly announces she is resigning as SNP leader and first minister, saying she knows \"in my head and in my heart\" this is the right time to step down. The Daily Record reports later that month that police interviewed key witnesses in the SNP, including Mr Chapman, as part of Operation Branchform just days before Ms Sturgeon stepped down.\nNicola Sturgeon announced her intention to step down at a news conference in February 2023\n16 March 2023 - The SNP confirms that members, who are eligible to take part in its leadership contest, has fallen to just over 72,000. Two of the candidates had demanded to know how many members were eligible to vote but the party had refused to tell them. Two days later Peter Murrell takes responsibility for the misleading of the media about party membership numbers and resigns from the chief executive role he has held since 1999. The SNP's media chief, Murray Foote, had already quit after ridiculing newspaper reports - which later turned out to be true - that the party had lost 30,000 members. 27 March 2023 - Humza Yousaf wins the SNP leadership contest, beating Kate Forbes and Ash Regan in a vote of party members. The following day he is confirmed as the new first minister. 5 April 2023 - Mr Murrell is arrested at the Glasgow home he shares with Nicola Sturgeon. He is questioned under caution and later released without charge pending further investigation. Police also search the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh and confiscate a luxury motorhome parked in the driveway of Mr Murrell's 92-year-old mother in Fife. According to reports it has been there since early 2021 and was said to have been purchased as an election campaign bus, but never used.\nReuters Police spent two days searching the home Nicola Sturgeon shared with Peter Murrell\n18 April 2023 - SNP treasurer Colin Beattie is arrested at his home in Midlothian, and later released without charge pending further investigation. The following day he resigns his position as party treasurer. 25 April 2023 - Nicola Sturgeon tells reporters she had no idea such events were about to unfold when she announced her resignation two months earlier, and describes them as her \"worst nightmare\". She also continues to insist that the police investigation played no part in her decision to stand down. 16 May 2023 - Police Scotland confirms it asked for warrants to search the home of Peter Murrell and Nicola Sturgeon while the SNP leadership contest was still under way, but had to wait two weeks for permission to go ahead, by which time the contest was over. 11 June 2023 - Nicola Sturgeon is arrested and taken into custody after attending a police interview, by prior arrangement, in connection with the inquiry. She is released without charge seven hours later, pending further investigation. 18 April 2024 - Mr Murrell is re-arrested as part of the Police Scotland investigation and later charged over embezzlement of SNP funds. 23 May 2024 - Police Scotland officers working on Operation Branchform submit a report to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\nPA Media Nicola Sturgeon said she and Peter Murrell had been separated for \"some time\" and had decided to end their marriage",

      "content_en": "Project Willow: Grangemouth opportunities at a glance\n5 days ago Share Save Share Save\nGetty Images\nThe Grangemouth industrial complex is one of Scotland's major manufacturing facilities - but the imminent closure of Scotland's only oil refinery threatens 400 jobs. Project Willow, a £1.5m feasibility study funded by the UK and Scottish governments, looks at potential low-carbon alternative uses for the wider site. Consultants EY evaluated 300 technologies - and came up with nine ideas that could be developed with private sector investment.\n1. Hydrothermal plastics recycling\nThis involves breaking down hard-to-recycle plastics such as clingfilm-type products to produce naptha and pyrolysis oil vapour. Currently these plastics are usually incinerated or go to landfill. They could instead be reused in plastics production or refined as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. It would require about £150m-£250m of capital investment, create 35-60 jobs and operations could start before the end of 2028\n2. Dissolution plastics recycling\nThis uses chemicals to dissolve waste plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The material can then be reused to create new plastic products or packaging. Between 35 and 45 jobs could be created, with operations commencing late in 2028.\nGetty Images The report says new facilities at Grangemouth could tie in with planned deposit return schemes to boost plastic recycling\nA relatively low amount of capital investment of £25m-£30m would be required. Such technology could make use of plastic derived from bottle deposit return schemes when they are introduced across the UK.\n3. Acetone-Butanol-Ethanol biorefining\nWaste and by-products from sectors like food, drink, packaging and agriculture could be fermented using bacteria. This could produce low-carbon chemical products such as acetone, butanol or ethanol. Raw materials are plentiful - the amount of paper and cardboard waste currently produced in the UK is about 50 times the capacity of the plant being proposed for Grangemouth. EY believes 80-100 jobs could be created through £215m-£265m of capital investment, with operations starting in 2030.\n4. Second generation bioethanol\nSustainably-sourced Scottish timber and timber waste could be broken down and fermented to produce bioethanol. This is used in fuel blending, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.\nGetty Images Bioethanol facilities could tie in with moves to increase sustainable forestry\nThis option would compliment plans to scale up the amount of softwood production through forestry in Scotland. Between 50 and 60 jobs would be created from £350m-£430m of investment with production starting in 2032.\n5. Anaerobic digestion\nAnaerobic digestion is already carried out at dozens of small-scale plants across Scotland. The process takes animal waste and sewage sludge and ferments it into biomethane. The gas can then be used by local industry or injected into the gas grid. Although burning it releases carbon dioxide, it is considered carbon neutral because the carbon originates from the atmosphere rather than underground. The report says an investment of £15m-£25m would create 5 -10 jobs by 2028.\n6. Hydrogenated esters and fatty acids\nFats, oils and certain crops potentially grown in Scotland can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel. The process would require hydrogen - but that could be produced sustainably. China is currently investing heavily in this kind of fat and oil conversion technology, so an adequate supply of raw materials from Scotland would have to be secured. This would come in part from used cooking oil, tallow and fish oil but would need to be supplemented by oil seed crop production. It would require hefty investment, from £740m-£900m, but would also save a lot of carbon emissions and support 90-120 jobs. Production could start by 2032.\n7. Hydrogen fuel switching\nHydrogen can be produced from water using a process called electrolysis. It requires electricity but this could come from renewable sources provided it is cheap enough. Low-carbon hydrogen could then be used as a replacement for natural gas in industrial processes.\nPA Media The report urges action to make renewable electricity cheaper so that large-scale green hydrogen production through electrolysis becomes more commercially viable\nThe reports says the UK government should reform the energy market to reduce the cost of renewable electricity to industrial consumers, making green hydrogen production more commercially attractive. About 25-30 jobs would be created by late 2030 with £210m-£250m of investment required.\n8. E-methanol for aviation fuel\nIf enough low-carbon hydrogen is produced at a reasonable cost, this could in turn be used to make methanol - which can be converted to aviation fuel. Grangemouth is already a supplier of far less environmentally-friendly jet fuels to Scottish airports. Such manufacturing facilities could create between 240 and 270 jobs but it would be 2036 before production gets under way. This option would also require around £2bn of new investment in the site.\n9. E-ammonia",

But why was it needed?\nThere were more boos at full-time but a fair number of supporters had vanished by then. It would be too dramatic to say their optimism of making the World Cup also disappeared, but the fact is Greece are in Scotland's group and they have now done a proper psychological number on Scotland before those games in the autumn. Clarke said as much in the aftermath.\nHe has some months to ponder things now, a window in which to consider his next move. He suggested he regretted not changing his team a little more from Thursday to Sunday. He spoke about freshness, or lack of it. \"I'll go away and look at myself,\" he said.\nWhat might he be thinking about? The safe return of Ben Doak to add width and pace, for sure. The desperately needed reintroduction of Aaron Hickey after his awful injury woes, without question.\nClarke is deeply loyal to the players who have delivered for him, but Scott McKenna is playing in La Liga every week. The composition of his midfield, too. Kenny McLean has been a tremendous servant but the time has surely come for Ferguson to take over.\nRelegation to League B is, in itself, no great disaster. Scotland will win more games down there. They'll have a better chance of grabbing a play-off place in the next Euros while operating in less rarefied air.\nThe thing that made Sunday stunning was the complete disintegration of a team we thought had more about them. That was the takeaway. Clarke has been here before, but the hope was he would never be back here again.",

What’s really exciting this year is that we get to celebrate female entrepreneurship as part of the programme of events.\n“How many people know that the tearoom was invented by a Glasgow woman?”\nOliver Braid, National Trust for Scotland’s creative learning manager at Mackintosh at the Willow, said: “The Scottish tearoom phenomenon of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is increasingly recognised for its cultural and culinary significance, shaping Scotland’s food, drink, and social histories of gender, race and class.”\nThe programme includes a talk by writer Perilla Kinchin on the history of Kate Cranston’s tea rooms, as well as historical talks on tea smuggling, the dark history of sugar as a product of Caribbean slavery, and how sugar became part of Scotland’s national identity.\nIt also features a session on the “creative confections” inspired by the rise of afternoon tea, such as shortbread and the empire biscuit, and the recipes that defined Scottish tea-taking rituals.",

      "content_en": "The Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland (CTUS), an independent foundation offering grants to support access to higher education, commissioned a poll on Scotland's “value, accessibility and funding of higher education” in Scotland.\nConducted by Ipsos Public Affairs, the poll showed widespread support for some form of Scottish Government-funded tuition. However, there was significant variation on how that should be implemented and who should be targeted for support.\nAlmost half (48%) of participants supported charging university tuition fees based on ability to pay, particularly if government funding was focused on those with lower household incomes, those who face historical barriers to entry, or those studying courses where there are skills shortages, such as nurses or engineers.\nLess than one-third (29%) directly opposed the idea.\nGeneral support for change but division on the direction\nScottish universities charge tuition fees for undergraduate degrees, with limits set by the Scottish and UK Governments. How much each student pays depends on their chosen university, where they live, whether or not they have previously attended university, and whether they are studying full-time or part-time.\nThe Scottish Government covers all tuition fees for full-time students living in Scotland and attending a Scottish university for their first undergraduate degree. The government's per student rate is dependent on the subject of study, and includes a standard £1,820 fee per student.\nThe government only covers tuition for part-time Scottish students if their household income is below £25,000.\nNon-Scottish students pay tuition fees at different rates, depending on whether they live in the UK. Students from the rest of the UK pay a set rate of £9,535 per year, while fees for international students are much higher, depending on the course and at the discretion of each university. Some range as high as £50,000 per year.\nParticipants were divided on whether the Scottish Government should cover the costs for all first-time undergraduate students living in Scotland (44%) or focus on low-income students while those whose households can afford it pay at least some of the cost of tuition (43%).\nFully government-funded tuition for all first-time undergraduates was most popular among those living in higher-income households of over £100,000 annually, those with children at home, younger age groups, and those who attended university.\nThe poll also asked participants to consider potential options for changing the tuition model in Scotland.\nThe most popular option was charging tuition fees based on ability to pay (48%). Under this system, students from lower-income households would pay low or no fees, and students from higher-income households would pay more.\nOpinions on this strategy differed depending on participants' household incomes. Charging tuition to those more able to pay was generally less popular among higher income brackets.\nRequiring employers to pay some contribution to the cost of university education was the second most popular option (39%).\nAnother favoured option was to charge tuition fees to all undergraduate students living in Scotland, with loans available that would only start being paid back once graduates began earning above a certain income level (35%). Many respondents, however, were opposed to this (43%).\nThe idea of a graduate tax, which would require all university graduates to pay a higher income tax once they earn above a certain level, was the least popular option (26% supported) and had the most direct opposition (48% opposed).\nParticipants were also asked what level of annual tuition fee they thought was reasonable to charge an undergraduate for a four-year degree. Opinion was relatively evenly split on fees up to £5,000 per year.\nThe most popular annual fee rate was between £3,000 and £4,999 (22%), followed by £1,500-£2,999 (21%) and less than £1,500 (20%).\nTargeted tuition support a popular strategy\nIf the government were to begin offering targeted tuition support, nearly two-thirds participants said low-income students should be the highest priority, followed by students studying courses where there are skill shortages, such as nursing (59%), and then students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nParticipants also clearly supported government funding to prioritise apprenticeships, grants for disadvantaged students, and upskilling for existing workers.\nRead more\nIn response to the poll results, CTUS announced it was commissioning a Citizen Jury to assemble a representative sample of Scots to investigate the higher education funding and make recommendations.\nHannah Garrow, Chief Executive of the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, said the question of funding is “complex” and has long-ranging consequences for families and society.\n”However, recent discussions on how to finance higher education feel like they are stuck on repeat, while, for many people, funding continues to be seen as a barrier to access\".\n“This research shows that there is room for a more nuanced and open discussion on priorities for funding. If politicians are struggling to come up with solutions, perhaps the public can inject some democratic innovation into the debate.\n\"The government has already committed to lead the development of a new funding model so understanding the views of the public as beneficiaries and users of the system is critical.\n“We hope that the Scottish Government and all political parties in Scotland will get behind our Citizen Jury and commit to giving its outcomes careful consideration.\"\nPoll comes as universities face funding uncertainty\nThe publication of the Ipsos and CTUS poll comes only days after new data showed a sharp decline in the number of fee-paying international students at Scottish universities, a key source of income for many institutions.\nMultiple universities are facing financial challenges, with an estimated eight of 18 expected to report deficits when the newest sector analysis is released. Most recently, the University of Dundee announced a deficit and controversial draft recovery plan that includes cuts to 632 jobs, but other universities, including the University of Edinburgh—which has forecast a £140 million deficit over 18 months—are also looking to close gaps in their budget.\nThe Scottish Government has remained committed to providing free tuition for Scottish students, but university leaders are increasingly calling for a nuanced conversation about the amount of funding that the government provides.",

So, we now need to make sure that we do realise those efficiency savings so we can invest in the priorities.”\nDuring the interview, the Chancellor also refused to rule out slashing tax on tech giants.\nThere have been reports that the government might consider changing or ditching the Digital Services Tax, which imposes a 2% levy on the profits of firms like Facebook, in order to avoid the global tariffs that the Trump administration is planning to impose.\nAsked if this was true, Ms Reeves said the UK is in discussions \"around a whole range of things\" with the US related to tariffs.\n\"But we will continue to operate on that principle that you should pay taxes in the country in which you operate.\"\nAsked if she might tweak the tax, she said: \"You've got to get the balance right, and those discussions at the moment are ongoing.\n\"We want to make progress. We do not want to see British exporters subject to higher tariffs, and we want to see trade barriers fall right across the world.\"\nREAD MORE\nIn his interview, Mr Leishman also said his party has not done enough for the 400 workers at Grangemouth being made redundant.\nThe MP suggested using the redevelopment of Manchester United’s Old Trafford stadium as a bargaining chip.\nThe club is owned by billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is chairman and chief executive of the site’s part-owners, Ineos.\nPlans for the new stadium were announced earlier this year, but the club is looking for Government support to regenerate the surrounding area. The money for which, Mr Leishman says, should be withheld if the refinery closes.\n“When we look at the regeneration needed around Old Trafford, why would we not say you can have that money, but you need to keep Grangemouth open? That’s just negotiation in my opinion,” he told the magazine.\n“I have asked those questions of why we haven’t done this, and the answers have been underwhelming.”",

God love them.\nOh oh oh\nEverywhere we go\nWatching Albion Rovers\nPutting on a show.\nJanet Prentice, who’s in charge of the boardroom hospitality is introducing me to her nephew, four-year-old Magnus Forbes Prentice Campbell.\n“He was a shareholder at one year old,” says Janet. “Everyone who comes through these doors is treated like family. If that wasn’t the case there’d be little point in keeping it going.\n\"If Albion Rovers was forced to close, the impact would be felt across the entire community. But I’m sensing that more locals are becoming aware of our plight and are stepping up.”\nThis is where amidst a picture gallery of club heroes like their former manager and ex-Rangers star, Davie Provan.\nRead More: Why whisky tasting was the most Scottish moment in my life\nThere’s a picture of one John Smith, a supporter who was inducted into the Albion Rovers Hall of Fame who began supporting the club during the second world war and was “one of the few supporters to remember the Rovers playing in top flight league football during season 1947-48”.\nThat team of legends included Jock Stein, who made 236 appearances for the Rovers before moving to Llanelli in Wales and then to captain Celtic where he emerged as the most important figure in the history of the Hoops.\nIt’s at this point you have to ask the question: couldn’t Celtic, the richest club in Scotland, spare a few bob to help out this one which is woven into their history.\nGenerations of Coatbridge families have provided support for Celtic. Surely there is still sufficient sentiment amidst their fiduciary corporate responsibilities to help the Rovers in their darkest hours?\nRonnie Boyd gently steers me away from this line of thought and talks about Celtic and Rangers having to be run as businesses in a fiercely competitive market.\nAnd so he introduces me to Chris Ide, the club doctor, who’s been providing this service for 19 seasons and refused to take a penny in return.\nHe’d originally been a Portsmouth supporter and I’m eager to tell him about my guilty (and utterly useless passion) of learning football lists in my youth, including the fact that Portsmouth won back to back league titles in 1949 and 1950 and that, having won the FA Cup in 1939 before the outbreak of war, they’re the longest-ever holders of the trophy.\nIt’s a form of madness, but today I’m overjoyed that at last someone has appreciated it.\n“My functions are mainly now ornamental,” he says. “I make the tea and help with stadium maintenance.”\nAt the back of the bar, there’s a young team discussing their plans for the evening.\nLet me introduce you to Jason Watson, Jack (Shug) Donnelly, Ryan Kelly and Nathan McPherson.\n“There’s nowhere else we’d rather be on a Saturday afternoon,” says Ryan, who like many others around here, has forsaken Celtic’s Hollywood attractions to follow the Rovers.\n“This is where I’ve made friends for life,” says Jason.\n“It’s one of the places where I’m at my happiest and we’ll do everything to help this club get through this.”\nA thorny nest of boardroom politics has brought Albion Rovers to this parlous state.\nRead More: SNP’s departing MSPs represent the worst of us. They won't be missed\nThis is a private limited company and though the overwhelming majority of shareholders have sought to co-opt new members with expertise and ideas to move the club forward they’ve been blocked at every turn by a handful of large shareholders, led by a single individual.\nNo explanations have been forthcoming as they’re not obliged to justify their reasoning. The others can only guess darkly at their motives.\n“More than 100k a year has gone from our budget after we dropped out of the fourth tier of the senior leagues two seasons ago,” says Ronnie.\n“But that’s what we need if we are to continue paying our players and coaching staff.\n\"I don’t know how long we could sustain this club in these circumstances, but I do know this: I can live with us turning amateur if it means I can still watch them playing on that turf.”\nHis colleague, Donnie Lind, whose grandfather attended Rovers’ only Scottish Cup final against Kilmarnock in 1920 (attendance: 95,000) said: “Another problem is that even when we played clubs like Stenhousemuir, they brought a core travelling support of about 150 which makes a significant difference.\n\"Now we’re playing the likes of Stirling University whose travelling support is a few students with Pot Noodles.”\nThey’re immediate hopes may now rest on a planned artificial pitch behind one of the goals which would enable them to charge rental for community use.\n“It’s a race against the clock, though,” says Ronnie Boyd.\nAt 5.49 on Saturday afternoon, Rovers are edging towards a drab 0-0 draw that suits neither team.\nThe playing surface would put many loftier clubs to shame and there have been flashes of skill, not least from Rovers’ big Spanish teenage striker, Bright Prince Okosun, (although I spend the second half urging him to put his considerable physical presence to better use).\nBut what do I know? The big man’s only gone and sent a towering header past the keeper to secure all three points.\nThe stand erupts and I’m happier that I’d ever expected to be at the outcome of a game in the fifth tier of Scottish football in North Lanarkshire.\n“If you come to the Rovers and don’t fall in love with them then there’s something wrong with you,” says Mary Allen.\nShe speaks the truth, because I’m putting my name down for a season ticket.",

The idea of inclusivity is all well and good, but the reality is there are some children who need support over and above what mainstream provides.\n“While all these platitudes are nice - that everybody is equal - the world isn’t like that. We’re supposed to be giving children an education which ties in with their needs and abilities. We should push them to reach their potential, but we shouldn’t do that in a way that’s detrimental to their health and wellbeing.\n“Shoving kids into mainstream school because it’s cheaper is easy.”\nAnother parent said: \"Exclusion is a society-wide issue that can’t be fixed by throwing all the kids in together and hoping that in 20 years there will be an inclusive society.”\nFamilies also shared their anxiety over the incoming £5bn of cuts to welfare being brought forward by the UK Government.\nJoanne Lamond said: \"Too many young people with ASN face a future of increased dependency, not because of their conditions, but due to systemic failures in education, healthcare, and employment support that’s set them up for economic failure.\n“Instead of penalising the most vulnerable, the government must focus on creating inclusive policies that provide genuine opportunities for all.\n\"Loss of income decreases your quality of life and increases the stress for the family, particularly single parent families. As my child isn’t in school, I also have increased costs of them being at home, and trying to provide the activities that support their meagre educational experience.”\n\"I feel abandoned by the state, which has become cruel. These attitudes have permeated into services which are the gatekeepers of support. It’s an incredibly challenging position as a parent to find yourself in”.",

The UVC rays are the strongest but are almost entirely absorbed by the Earth’s ozone layer. It’s the UVA and UVB rays we need to worry about.\n“B is for burns. UVB rays cause redness, skin damage, those sunburns on holidays,” Fraser says. “A is for ageing. UVA rays are there every day.”\n“What I wanted to do was create a company where that was the centre point of the story,” he adds. “And hopefully through education and really great products, people would realise they need to look after their skin preventatively.”\n(Image: Karene Wedekind)\nRead more from Marissa MacWhirter\nIt’s hard not to be impressed by the young entrepreneur. Fraser, of Bearsden, started his first business at just 13 years old selling sweets door to door. As he grew up, he promised himself that he would launch his first company by the time he was 30.\nLast spring, at 29, Fraser’s personal deadline was fast approaching. He had been working in tech marketing for an American company for a few years when he decided it was time to take the plunge. As much as he loved his job, it was all-consuming and he needed to be all in if it was going to work.\n“I was like, right, you’re going to have to hold yourself accountable,” he recalls. “You want to do this, it’s not just going to happen.”\nHis interest in health and well-being, coupled with his love of marketing, was the launchpad. “I felt that in the skincare market, there were a lot of hyperfeminine products,” he says. “There are also a lot of really clinical products and it can be overwhelming with all these chemical names.\n“I felt there was a gap to position something as lifestyle, gender-neutral with more of a masculine edge to it than a feminine edge. And the number one thing that causes skin damage, ageing, and wrinkles is the sun.\n“You can have all of the chemicals, serums, retinols and peptides in the world, but the reality is that it’s the same with diet and the same with fitness. It’s all about preventative measures.”\nThe next problem Fraser sought to solve was just how much of a nightmare some sunscreen formulas can be. Memories of thick white sunscreen smeared across your face on holiday in Spain spring to mind. “The reason that a lot of people don’t wear sunscreen daily is that they feel horrible, they clog your pores, they stain your t-shirt, they give your skin a white cast or they are sticky.\n“I tried every SPF moisturiser I could find and I didn’t like any of them. Could there be a brand that simplified skincare, reducing the complexity of it all? A simple morning and evening routine with the core being UV protection because that is where the damage is coming from?”\nThe result is a pared-back line suitable for sensitive skin. The products are all vegan, cruelty-free, dermatologically tested and made without parabens, sulphates or silicone. There’s the Daily Hydrating Cleanser to be used day and night with hydrating and exfoliating properties. Then there are the Daily AM Energising Serum and the Daily PM Calming Serum. And of course, the Daily Protection Moisturiser. Calming After Sun Gel, Natural Mineral Sunscreen Lotion and Lip Protection Oil with SPF 25 round off the product line.\nThe simple branding with labels in Pantone perfect shades of blue, green and olive gives the bottles that coveted top-shelf appeal. The aesthetics of the brand were something Fraser thought carefully about, even lending to his decision to call the brand dussl.\n“I took a lot of inspiration from business podcasts and books,” he says. “There is this idea of combining different words to create a unique word and then your brand becomes the definition of that word. I loved that.\n“I tried traditional Scottish words or words that meant hydration or skin but it was hard to find something unique – and to own the SEO traffic that sits with it.”\nIt had to be short and easy to remember. Fraser spent hours writing out word combinations trying to find the right fit. “I had sticky notes all over my walls in my office,” he smiles. The result, dussl, is symmetrical, rolls off the tongue and sounds a bit like hustle. It fits perfectly with the idea that simplified skincare is ideal for people on the go.\n“The other thing, which is really random but quite cool, is SSL is a tech protocol,” Fraser adds. “Secure Socket Layer. It’s security, it protects. And sunscreen is protecting your face.”\nLast month, the brand held a special launch event at the designer lifestyle store HOOS on Great Western Road. It gave Fraser the chance to meet customers face to face and share his infectious enthusiasm for his new brand. “I chatted to anyone who would listen to me,” he says. “We pretty much sold out three lines of products right away: the cleanser, the SPF 50 moisturiser and the lip oil.”\nAnd yes, plenty of people wanted to know why they needed SPF in Glasgow. “I would chat them through it, and as soon as I would talk them through the UV rays they would say, that’s really cool I didn’t understand that. The positivity overall was amazing.”\nAs part of his dedication to skin health, Fraser has made it a priority to partner with skin cancer charities, donating 1 per cent of all dussl revenue to Melanoma UK.\n“Skin health is part of our overall health and wellbeing. You have your diet, your exercise, your nutrition. But your skin is your biggest organ, that’s what faces the world.”\nTo find out more, visit www.dussl.com.\nMarissa MacWhirter is the editor of The Glasgow Wrap.

My other life is a filmmaker, I’ve spent my career making commercials, short films and music videos, facilitating other people rather than doing something for myself. So I think I probably had a bit of an existential crisis.\n\"Everybody had other things going, our bass player Dom was the creative director in an advertising agency, Al the drummer is a post-production guy in film and TV, Shahen the accordion player is a civil servant in the Home Office and, obviously, Tim Dowling is a columnist on The Guardian – so we’re quite an eclectic bunch.\n\"You don’t have to make a living from it, which is the good thing. We don’t lose money doing it, we do this on a professional basis and consider ourselves professional but without relying on it to make a living.\n“So we approach it with a degree or seriousness and professionalism without, I hope, taking ourselves too seriously – which would be ridiculous at our age.\n\"We’ve been described as pop music with all the wrong instruments – accordion, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, trumpet, bass, drums and acoustic guitar – so sonically it’s an Americana roots landscape but lyrically and sensibility-wise very British. Not just English, we have several Scottish songs with Scottish subject matter.\n“We’re concerned with our real lives in this isles as opposed to looking to America and singing songs about Tennessee and railroads.\n“The touring has been very central to the whole thing from the very beginning because it was the only way of finding out whether what we were doing was any good or not.\n“We weren’t expecting that aspect of what we do to be the thing people liked, but it turns out it’s the thing that people overwhelmingly like about us, much to our surprise. Someone described us as a ‘seven-headed joy machine’ and I’ll have that!\"\nPolice Dog Hogan play SWG3 in Glasgow on April 4 and The Voodoo Rooms in Edinburgh on April 5.

      "content_en": "As of March 2023 there were 1,037 care homes for adults in Scotland of which 792 (76%) were for older people, 146 (14%) were for learning disabilities, 52 (5%) were for mental health problems, and 33 (3%) were for physical and sensory impairment.\nOver 40,000 people in Scotland live in care homes, of which 92% are resident in care homes for older people.\nThat figure is only likely to increase in the coming years, with 20% of Scotland's population now over 65.\nRead More:\nSince October 2016, the Scottish Government and local authorities have committed to paying adult social care workers the national living wage during waking hours, with this provision expanded in 2018-19 to include those undertaking sleepovers.\nThe latest Scottish Government budget reaffirms this commitment, with the UK Government having increased the national living wage to £12.21 per hour from April 2025, and Holyrood has provided funding for local authorities to increase the rate paid to carers to £12.60.\nThe move was initially welcomed, providing care staff in Scotland with a 'premium' compared to the rest of the UK.\nHowever, new analysis undertaken by the STUC has found that the estimated 64,000 residential care workers in Scotland are now earning less on average than their counterparts in the rest of the UK.\n(Image: STUC) A report found residential care worker pay in Scotland is now 11p lower than it is in the rest of the UK, having been 38 pence an hour higher just five years ago. In 2020, residential care workers in Scotland were paid 4% more than the typical UK care worker, but by 2024 they earned 1% less.\nResidential care worker pay in Scotland has increased by £2.27 over that period but that is less than the increase in the minimum wage (£2.72), average earnings (£3.44) and carer pay in the rest of the UK (£2.76).\nBecause pay is tied to the national living wage, a greater increase in the minimum wage compared to that measure penalises those in the care sector in relative terms.\nFrom April 2020 to April 2024 the median pay for residential care workers in Scotland rose by 21.6% but the minimum wage increased by 31.2% while median pay for carers elsewhere in the UK rose by 27.2%.\nIn 2020, residential care workers were paid 20% more than the UK minimum wage, by 2024, this had fallen to 12%, meaning any 'wage premium' carers receive is being eroded.\n(Image: STUC) The impact of inflation has also hit the sector hard.\nAccording to the STUC data, in the last five years residential care workers have seen a real-terms pay cut of 2.1% using CPI (consumer price index) inflation and 9.6% using RPI (retail price index).\nThe report concludes: \"The Scottish Government’s policy of increasing pay in the social care sector in line with the real living wage is no longer fit for purpose.\n\"Residential care worker pay is being left behind by the minimum wage, inflation, average earnings in the rest of the economy, and residential care worker pay in the rest of the UK. Unchecked, these trends will only serve to exacerbate the crisis in Scotland’s social care system, with knock-on impacts on delayed discharge from hospitals.\"\nThe STUC is calling on the Scottish Government to increase pay in social care to £15 per hour, introduce sectoral bargaining - in which agreements would by negotiated on behalf of and apply to the whole sector - and, in the mean time, increase pay in line with or above percentage increases in average earnings, the minimum wage, and residential care worker pay in the rest of the UK.\nSandra, a care worker, told The Herald: \"One of the things that could sort it out is sectoral bargaining, so that everyone who works in social care has the same terms and conditions.\n“We’re all providing local authorities with services, they pay for the contracts, so we should all have the same annual leave, the same pay - but it’s not that way.\"\nIncreasing levels of privatisation are also impacting care workers.\nA 2021 report produced by GMB found that, on average, pay was £1.60 lower in the private sector than the public sector.\n(Image: Getty) A study released late last year by Public Health Scotland found a 20% decrease in the number of people in local authority or health board care homes for older people between 2013 and 2023, with 76% of homes now run by the private sector.\nAgency worker Tamara told The Herald: \"I work predominantly in private care but when I do shifts in the local authority homes I do find the staff are happier and there are more of them.\n“The local authorities are held more accountable by the Scottish Government than the private care sector is, because those homes are obviously just run for profit.\n“Local authorities get funding from the government so they’re held more to account whereas the private ones don’t rely on that as much so they don’t face the same kind of accountability.\n“There are also better training opportunities and better equipment, I find that things are better and more smoothly run.”\nIssues within the private sector have been highlighted by trades unions for some time.\nIn 2021, a GMB survey found that nearly three quarters of care home workers felt that they did not have enough time to deliver safe and dignified care.\nThis is borne out in a new STUC report which uses Care Inspectorate data to examine differences in staffing resources across private, voluntary and public sector care homes for older people.\nIt found staffing levels were 20% lower in private care homes than in the public sector or voluntary sector.\nThe data compared the number of registered places in a care home to the number of full-time staff.\nOn average, private sector care homes had 1.3 places for each staff member, compared to 1.08 in not-for-profit care homes.\nThe STUC said: \"Staffing ratios in residential care homes matter. They matter for patient care, for health and safety, and for staff wellbeing. This report shows that staffing resources in private care homes are significantly lower than in public and voluntary care homes.\n\"Yet to date, Scottish Government proposals for reform of the care sector have not given any attention to different staffing ratios in the private, voluntary and public sector.\n\"Given the plethora of evidence that the not-for-profit sector has better staffing ratios, less complaints, and higher pay, any meaningful reform to improve social care must propose substantive changes to who actually provides care.\"\nConcerns have also been raised about the potential impact of Britain's decision to leave the European Union on the provision of health and social care.\nA 2022 report by the Scottish Government found that around 6.2% of staff in adult care homes were from the EU, a total of 3290.\nWhile there had been no statistically significant decrease in this number since the Brexit vote, of those studied 75% said it had become more difficult in the wake of leaving the European Union to recruit staff for care homes, while 30% said EU staff had left in the previous 12 months.\nDecreases in immigration present a demographic problem for Scotland, which has the lowest population growth in the UK, with the 2.7% increase in the last census driven entirely by inward migration.\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said: “We value the vital role social care workers play in delivering high-quality care to people of Scotland.\n“We also remain deeply concerned about the impact the increase in Employers National Insurance Contributions (ENICs) will have across the social care sector.\n“Our 2025/26 budget provides an additional £125 million to enable adult social care workers, delivering direct care in commissioned services, to be paid at least £12.60 an hour, in line with the Real Living Wage. This £125m takes our total investment in improving social care pay to £950 million.\n“This is higher than the National Living Wages which applies to many social care workers in England and Northern Ireland.”",

      "content_en": "In January the Scottish Government shelved plans for a 'national care service' which would have brought structural reforms to the way in which adult social care is delivered.\nThe plans, first put forward in 2021, would have made social care the responsibility of the Scottish Government rather than local authorities which then health and social care minister Humza Yousaf said would \"end the postcode lottery of care in Scotland\".\nRead More:\nThe plans would have seen services commissioned nationally through regional care boards, under ministerial direction, as well as the creation of a national social work agency to oversee social work education, professional development, improvement, workforce planning and terms and conditions.\nThe scheme faced significant opposition, however, losing the support of COSLA and the STUC, with concerns it failed to address key issues such as pay and took decision making powers away from local authorities.\nAs revealed in The Herald on Sunday, residential carers in Scotland are now earning less, on average, than their counterparts in the rest of the UK.\nCare home pay in Scotland is linked to the national living wage, but unions have warned that model is no longer fit for purpose with that measure failing to grow as quickly as real wages, minimum wage and inflation.\nHourly pay will rise to £12.60 in 2025, above the national living wage of £12.21, but the STUC is calling on Holyrood to guarantee £15 to prevent care workers falling further behind.\nThe body said: \"The Scottish Government’s policy of increasing pay in the social care sector in line with the real living wage is no longer fit for purpose. Residential care worker pay is being left behind by the minimum wage, inflation, average earnings in the rest of the economy, and residential care worker pay in the rest of the UK. Unchecked, these trends will only serve to exacerbate the crisis in Scotland’s social care system, with knock-on impacts on delayed discharge from hospitals.\n\"To address these issues the Scottish Government should restore five years of pay erosion by increasing pay in social care to £15 an hour; Introduce sectoral bargaining in social care, a recommendation first proposed by the Fair Work Convention in 2019, but not yet acted on by the Scottish Government; until sectoral bargaining is established, introduce a triple lock on social care worker pay – increasing pay in line with or above percentage increases in average earnings, the minimum wage, and residential care worker pay in the rest of the UK; safeguard and extend public sector provision, which has fallen in the last 10 years.\"\nWriting in The Herald on Sunday, STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said: \"We’ve listened to the promises of the Scottish Government: from their championed but ultimately doomed National Care Service Bill to their pledges to get our care workers to £15 per hour. Ultimately, neither has materialised and it is having a crippling impact on our workforce.\n\"Residential care workers have suffered a severe 9.6% real terms pay cut in the last five years with their pay 27% less than the average worker. Our research further reveals that care workers in Scotland would be £944 a year better off had residential care worker pay in Scotland tracked pay in the rest of the UK over the last five years.\n\"Far from being underpaid, care workers are being undercut and having their pay stripped away from their bare hands.\"\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said: “We value the vital role social care workers play in delivering high-quality care to people of Scotland.\n“We also remain deeply concerned about the impact the increase in Employers National Insurance Contributions (ENICs) will have across the social care sector.\n“Our 2025/26 budget provides an additional £125 million to enable adult social care workers, delivering direct care in commissioned services, to be paid at least £12.60 an hour, in line with the Real Living Wage.

      "content_en": "The decline represents a significant challenge for universities, which rely on tuition fees from international students and undergraduate and postgraduate levels to sustain their operations. International student fees vary by programme and university, but some are £50,000 per year or more.\nAccording to the most recent data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), there were 10,060 fewer international higher education students at Scottish universities than the year before and 10,785 fewer students overall.\nIn 2023/2024, 73,915 non-UK students accounted for 26% of the total HE students in Scotland (281,455).\nThe year before, there were 83,975 non-UK students out of 292,240 students overall (28%).\nStatistics show that the most significant decline in international students was among taught postgradute courses, which recorded 7,960 fewer non-UK students compared to 2022/2023.\nScottish universities \"dangerously reliant\" on international fees\nWhen student statistics for the 2022/2023 academic year were published last autumn, the data showed a slight increase in international students to a record-high of over 83,000.\nHowever, official enrolment statistics are often a year or more old when released. University leaders quickly warned that these numbers were outdated and did not reflect the full impacts of recent UK Government immigration policy changes and global economic and political crises.\nClaire McPherson, director of Universities Scotland, said the newest data, published this week, justifies those concerns and \"catches up with the reality that universities have experienced over the last 18 months.\"\nShe added that the \"sudden, sharp fall\" in postgraduate taught students (down 25% on average across Scotland) \"has flipped the pattern of five years of growth of enrolments on its head\".\n“It is both the scale and the suddenness of the fall that has been incredibly challenging for many institutions to manage. Scotland’s model of funding Scottish students and university research has become dangerously reliant on cross-subsidy from international students over the last decade because of chronic underfunding.\n\"That puts institutions in a hugely exposed position, as today’s official statistics show for the sector, and for some institutions more acutely than others. This week, the Permanent Secretary confirmed that university finances are high up on the Scottish Government’s risk register.\n\"There is a very pressing need for a different kind of strategic conversation with the Scottish Government about short-term stability and long-term solutions for the sustainability of our universities.\"\nDifferent realities at different institutions\nUniversities rely on international students' fees to cover the costs of teaching, and they have become increasingly necessary for cross-subsidising the costs of teaching Scottish students.\nA recent Herald investigation found that Scottish Government funding for Scottish students covers less than half of the costs of teaching some subjects.\nHowever, as Ms McPherson explained, every university has a different relationship with international students as part of its enrolment total and with individual recruitment markets.\n“The sector average fall of 25% (among international postgraduate taught students) conceals even sharper falls for some institutions, depending on the range of countries they recruit from.\n\"Demand from India and Nigeria has fallen, whereas demand from China and North America has remained relatively stable.\"\nRead more:\nIn 2024, the universities with the highest percentage of international students were the Universities of St Andrews (47%), Edinburgh (42%), Herriot-Watt (38%), and Glasgow (34%).\nThe lowest percentages were at the Open University (0%), Scotland's Rural College (1%), the University of the Highlands and Islands (3%), Abertay University (11%) and Queen Margaret University (19%).\nIn addition to having different makeups, each university was affected differently by the most recent decline in international students.\nIn 2023, international students made up 29% of Robert Gordon University's total, but that fell to 16% in 2024.\nThe Universities of Dundee and Aberdeen saw drops of around 4%, while St Andrews remained stable.\nEach percentage point represents potentially thousands of pounds\nBecause international tuition fees are much higher than what the Scottish Government provides for home students, changes in international student enrolment significantly impact university finances.\nHESA will not publish updated financial data for Scotland's universities until later in the Spring. Still, the most recent information indicates some of the country's universities rely on international tuition for more than a third of their total income. On average, international tuition represents 22% of Scottish HE income across the sector.\nBecause of the disproportionate reliance on international fees, individual universities will be hit harder by the recent decline in international students.\nAt Dundee University, for example, the institution is facing an urgent cash crisis. It recently received £22 million from the Scottish Government to allow time for implementing a larger recovery plan, which could include cuts of more than 600 jobs.\nAccording to HESA data, the number of international students at Dundee fell from 4,570 in 2023 to 3,335 in 2024. Again, the majority of these losses were at the postgraduate taught level, which, in many cases, includes prospective students from demographics more likely to be impacted by the UK's more restrictive visa and immigration policies which came into play.\nAlthough there are separate questions about potential mismanagement and errors in governance that may have amplified Dundee University's financial challenges, the new HESA data reinforces concerns that the sector as a whole is facing a financial crisis.\nAre there any possible solutions?\nStakeholders have been calling for changes to the funding model for higher and further education, in part to help universities end their reliance on international fees.\nThese discussions often devolve into a question of whether the Scottish Government should continue with its policy of free tuition for Scottish students attending home universities. This policy is made possible by the government's payment of a standard £1,820 fee and additional funding per student depending on their subject.\nThis line of questioning has proven to be a non-starter for the government. In the face of questions about the potential collapse of Dundee University, Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth recently confirmed that the government will not change its stance on free tuition.\nUniversity leaders have previously said that this conversation does not address the full extent of the problem, however.\nAs The Herald's investigation showed, government funding only covers an average of 58% of the costs of teaching any given subject.\nThis suggests that the larger question is less about who pays the tuition and more about how high the bill should be.",

      "content_en": "Visitors to these places can typically explore a whole host of fascinating exhibits designed to inform, entertain, and educate, and the goal is obvious: offer exciting, child-led exposure, built around a sense of wonder, and hope that this sparks an interest in – and maybe even a love of – science, technology and learning.\nBut most centres go further than that, even if people don’t always know about it, and the one housed in a purpose-built facility by Glasgow’s Clydeside is no different.\nThe Community Learning Team at Glasgow Science Centre works with a range of different organisations representing and supporting an enormously diverse selection of people. The educational experiences that they offer include interactive activities, workshops, public events and portable, pop-up exhibits, all designed to break down barriers to STEM specifically, and learning more generally, while also supporting personal development and community integration.\nIn recent years this has meant developing programmes for those from low-income households, disabled people, the elderly, young carers, LGBTQ+ groups, those with additional support needs, people for whom English is not their first language, specific men’s and women’s groups, and much more. Organisations including Interfaith Glasgow, Govan Men’s Shed, African Challenge, the Prince’s Trust, Glasgow Disability Alliance, Alzheimer Scotland, and City of Glasgow College have all worked with the Community Learning Team at Glasgow Science Centre to help enhance the services and support on offer to their clients and service users.\nThe Bothy in Glasgow Science Centre (Image: Glasgow Science Centre) When they are not taking mobile exhibits on tour around the city, or the country, much of the team’s education work takes place in The Bothy, a dedicated learning space that was installed during the enforced closures of the Covid pandemic. It is an open, welcoming space that offers the facilities of a modern classroom but in a less intimidating environment – a crucial consideration when a great deal of the target audience are already having to overcome personal and social barriers in order to take part in one of the courses on offer.\nIn recent weeks, the team has delivered a programme called Adding Value, a numeracy skills course, to a group of women for whom English is not their first language. Established with help from AMINA, the Muslim Women’s Resource Centre, the class helps adults develop confidence with numbers while also expanding their language skills. Lessons were delivered in English, but translation services were also made available, with the hope that students would become less dependent on this provision as they became more comfortable not just with the content, but with one another.\nThe course itself was fully certified and offered at SCQF level 3, which is roughly equivalent to an old Foundation Standard Grade. It was also internally assessed, meaning that students did not need to face a high-stakes, high-stress final exam, but still received formal recognition of their learning that can support progression to the next level of study in a setting such as a college.\nAlicia Robertson, Sheena McDonald and Amy Childs from the Community Learning Team at Glasgow Science Centre (Image: Steven Angus / Glasgow Science Centre)\nFor some of those taking part, the programme was an opportunity to enhance their numeracy skills with a view to accessing further education, or returning to courses that had previously proven too challenging due to the level of maths involved. Many others were motivated largely by the desire to help their children with school work that, due to language issues and different teaching approaches in their home countries, they might struggle to understand.\nBut some have a very different story: one student had an accounting degree from her home country and found that working through a course like this one, where the subject matter was very familiar, made it easier to improve her English skills.\nSimilar stories have emerged from earlier iterations of the programme, with participants having previously dropped out of education, or struggled to even access it in the first place. Sometimes poor numeracy skills were the main barrier, but more often than not the real roadblock was confidence, and in those cases courses like Adding Value can be in invaluable in opening the door to new opportunities.\nIn the best case scenarios, programmes like these can even be the starting point for a better life.\nFor more information on courses available from the Glasgow Science Centre, visit their website.

      "content_en": "Now a group of school girls hopes to change all that. Inspired by her example, the pupils, who attend Inverkeithing High School, have launched a campaign to call their new, Rosyth-based secondary school Janet McCallum High.\nNot only has their proposal made it onto a four-strong shortlist, their efforts have led to a dramatic new discovery: a medal given to McCallum to mark her incarceration.\n“When we heard about the consultation, we looked at the high schools across Fife and noticed a huge lack of diversity, with four — Bell Baxter, Waid, St Columba’s and St Andrew’s — named after men, and only one — Queen Anne — after a woman,” the group, who are campaigning anonymously, explained. “We wanted to find a positive local hero pupils will be able to look up to.”\nThe girls stumbled on McCallum through the work of Protests and Suffragettes: a team of artists and activists working to reclaim the histories of women activists in Scotland. McCallum was born in Dunfermline, grew up in Inverkeithing, and later led the 1919 Rosyth rent strike, so is intimately linked with the area.\nApproached by the pupils, volunteers at Protests and Suffragettes redoubled their efforts to research McCallum’s life, delving into archives and contacting relatives until - last week - they were handed photographs of the award by McCallum’s Edinburgh-based great niece, Sheila Perry.\nAn article in The Vote magazine from 1910 which lists “Miss Jenny McCallum” as marching (Image: Protests and Suffragettes)\nSimilar medals were handed out by the Emmeline Pankhurst-founded Women’s Social and Political Union to suffragettes who had been imprisoned, particularly those who had been on hunger strike. But by 1908 — the year of the protest — McCallum had left the WSPU and joined the Women’s Freedom League (WFL), a rival organisation set up in response to the Pankhursts’ increasingly autocratic leadership style.\nMcCallum’s medal, which depicts the front gates of Holloway and is engraved with date of her imprisonment — October 28 — was given to her by the WFL, and so is rarer.\n“This may be among the very first medals awarded to any suffragette by the WFL, which is exciting,” said Jill McKean, a volunteer with protests and Suffragettes and Blue Badge Tourist Guide with Scottish Highland Trails.\nRead more from Dani Garavelli:\nPerry, a history graduate who writes novels, was sent the photograph by relatives in South Africa where McCallum, her husband, Harry, who had worked in the Rosyth dockyard, and their three children emigrated in the 1920s.\n“I have always known about Jenny: that she was an activist, that she had red hair, which you can’t see in the photographs, but was a McCallum thing,” Perry said. “Jenny was friends with lots of Labour activists, and there is a family story that my mother [McCallum’s niece] was dandled as a baby on James Maxton’s knee while visiting Jenny in Rosyth.\n“I didn’t know much about what happened to the family after they went to South Africa, but a few days ago, a descendant of her daughter sent me photographs of both her passport and the medal, which I didn’t even know existed.”\nOn the day of the London protest, a group of suffragettes in the ladies gallery of the House of Commons, with its brass lattice screen, began shouting: “We have listened behind the grille long enough. The women of England demand the vote.” Meanwhile, according to one newspaper, in the Old Palace Yard, “four very athletic suffragettes [including McCallum] clambered on a statue”.\nCourt reports described McCallum as \"a little Scotch girl with a decided accent\" and mocked her appearance.\n“Scottish suffragettes don’t get much attention,” Perry said. “So I would be over the moon if the school was to be named after Jenny. She should be better known in her own locality.”\nThe Inverkeithing pupils are following in McCallum’s tradition with a spontaneous, grassroots campaign, which has involved not only carrying out their own research but lobbying the councillors.\n“We found out that, throughout 1907, [Jenny] helped organise a ‘Great Demonstration’, a [Fife] event that involved open air meetings and was attended by Christabel Pankhurst,” the campaigners said. “Later, with the WFL, she organised teatime meetings for working class suffragettes and campaigned against the oppression of all working class people.”\nShe must have kept in touch with the Pankhursts, too, as during the rent strikes she brought Sylvia to represent the tenants in court.\nCouncillor David Barratt, convenor of the South West Fife area committee, said: “We were looking for something meaningful — that Schooly McSchool Face was never going to cut it. This group of girls got in touch to say they would like to present their research to us. They were so engaged, it was really impressive.”\nA rare medal from Holloway has been discovered (Image: Protests and Suffragettes)\nIn the end, the council received hundreds of proposals, with more than 7,000 votes cast in an exercise to whittle them down. The shortlist was supposed to be three, but Barratt used his powers as convenor to extend it to four so Janet McCallum High could be included.\nThe other names to make the shortlist are Caledonia, which topped the poll, Rosyth and Forth. The £88m school, expected to open in August 2026, includes a steel representation of the Forth Bridge incorporated into its structure.\n“These were all popular proposals, but I wanted to accommodate the name put forward by the pupils, given it is their school, and also to help them to continue to raise awareness of Janet McCallum,” Barratt said.\nThe deadline for voting is 5pm on March 28. The girls said: “Janet was a very important figure in our community and deserves to be remembered and honoured for her amazing work in trying to make the world a better place.”\n“Whatever happens next the girls have done Janet proud,” Barratt added.",

      "content_en": "Writing for The Herald on Sunday, Anat Kraskin, the co-president of the Jewish Society, said a recent video by the Glasgow University Justice for Palestine Society (GUJPS) had left Jewish students \"expressing fear, distress, and disbelief\".\nProtests have ramped up in recent days, following Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, ordered a series of aerial attacks in the Palestinian territory, bringing to an end the fragile truce that has been in place since January.\nIt followed the collapse of talks over the release of hostages.\nThe strikes have killed hundreds, according to the Gazan Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\nREAD MORE\nOn Thursday around 100 students formed a blockade on University Avenue, the main road running through the West End campus.\nStudents also briefly took over the Charles Wilson building, ending their occupation in part because of police presence and after securing a commitment for a meeting with University Secretary David Duncan.\nThree students from GUJPS started a hunger strike on Wednesday — they have since been joined by three others.\nThey took to Instagram to set out a list of demands, including calls for the university to divest from the arms trade, the cutting of research ties with arms companies, and “no repercussions for activists” taking part in the protest.\nThey also called for the university to “ban arms companies and Zionists from our campus\".\nThe video then ended with the three shouting “long live the intifada\".\nMs Kraskin argues that when GUJPS talk about Zionists, they are talking about Jews.\nShe said: “When the overwhelming majority of Jewish people describe themselves as Zionists — polling often suggests over 80% of my community — then calling for their erasure is clearly antisemitic.\n“Indeed, while not the same, there is an undeniable connection between Jewish people and Israel. It is why Jewish people have prayed facing Jerusalem for millennia. Zionism is simply the belief that Jewish people have a right to a state in their ancestral homeland.”\nShe added: “Instead of openly targeting Jews, the focus has shifted to targeting Zionism, knowing full well that Zionism is inseparable from Jewish identity for the vast majority of Jews. It is a strategy designed to make antisemitism socially acceptable, but the intent remains unchanged.”\nMs Kraskin said the use of the phrase “long live intifada” was a “call for violence against Jewish people and to support the murder of Jews\".\n“This warrants expulsion from Glasgow University,” she added. “I would like to think that if any student expressed support for violence against any religious group on campus, they would be immediately expelled. Why does that standard never seem to apply to those expressing antisemitism?”\nThe term \"intifada\" is an Arabic word meaning \"uprising\" or \"shaking off,\" but in this context it refers to Palestinian uprisings against Israel.\nThe First Intifada between 1987 and 1993 began as a largely non-violent movement, involving protests, strikes, and civil disobedience, but escalated into violence over time.\nThe Second Intifada, however, was marked by significant violence, including suicide bombings, resulting in the deaths of 1,000 Israelis and 3,000 Palestinians.\nMs Kraskin also hit out at the Rector of the university, Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian plastic and reconstructive surgeon.\nHe won 80% of the student vote at the election last year. During his campaign he said he would seek to change the definition of antisemitism used by the University.\nIn 2021, the University adopted the definition which states that antisemitism is a “certain perception of Jews that may be expressed as hatred” toward them.\nIt also includes a series of examples of antisemitism including holding Israel to a “double standard” and claiming Israel’s existence is a “racist endeavour\".\nIn his manifesto, Dr Abu-Sittah said he believed the definition risked \"undermining freedom of speech and intellectual thought on campus” and that he would call for it to be replaced.\nIn her column, Ms Kraskin wrote: “Antisemitism in the UK is at some of the highest recorded levels, and Scottish universities have not been immune.\n\"Polling by the Community Security Trust suggests that antisemitism at British universities has risen by 117% over the past two years, continuing an already worrying trend.\n“Jewish students are not only fearful, but worse, we feel that our fears are being ignored, dismissed, or outright denied.\n“These feelings were most acutely felt following the election of the now Glasgow University Rector, who built his whole campaign around removing the IHRA definition, the most widely accepted definition of antisemitism, a definition endorsed by the overwhelming majority of representatives of Jewish communities around the world.“\nShe also criticised the Rector for giving the eulogy at the funeral of Maher Al-Yemani, the co-founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a proscribed terrorist group in the UK.\nMs Kraskin wrote: “A university should be a space for diverse opinions, but it cannot be a space for threats, intimidation, and incitement to violence.\n“When antisemitism is excused or tolerated under the false banner of political activism, the message is clear: Jewish students are not equally protected. They are expected to endure hostility that would be deemed unacceptable if directed at any other minority group.\n“Despite these challenges, I'm proud to say that we, Jewish students, have only grown stronger and more united. We continue to advocate for our rights, to challenge antisemitism, and to stand firm against hatred in all its forms.\n“However, our voices alone are not enough. We need the support of University administrations, political leaders, and the wider community to ensure that Jewish students, like all students, can pursue their education free from discrimination and harassment.”\nA spokesperson for the University of Glasgow said it recognised the concerns and took the complaints “extremely seriously\".\nThey added that any student believed to have used language which breached their Code of Conduct, would face disciplinary action, and any suspected hate crime would be reported to the police.\nThey also made clear that the Rector is not a member of the senior management group and his views, and those of student societies, do not represent those of the University.\nThe spokesperson said: \"The University’s priority is the safety and wellbeing of our students and colleagues, and we stand opposed to hate and harassment in any form.\n“The University fully recognises the concerns of Jewish students. Senior managers are in regular contact with the University’s Jewish Society as well as with leaders of the Jewish community in Scotland.\n\"We take complaints received about recent protests on campus extremely seriously. The University has contacted protesting groups, and everyone across our community, challenging in particular the use of language which is likely to cause harm and distress.\n\"As a University we have sought to tackle antisemitism, Islamophobia or any other form of racism on campus. In particular, we engaged extensively with the office of Lord Mann as he undertook an inquiry into Jewish student experiences in Higher Education and Glasgow’s work to address antisemitism is referenced throughout Lord Mann’s report.\"\nA spokerson for GUJPS said: \"As Kraskin acknowledges, Jewish identity and the modern nation-state of Israel — founded through the displacement and violent ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948 (known as the Nabka) and maintained through the structural enforcement of apartheid and genocide to this day (as argued before the ICJ by South Africa) — are not one and the same.\n\"Her theological argument that the connection between Jews and Israel is 'undeniable' holds no water as the basis of a modern political concept such as the nation-state, which did not develop until the mid-17th century with the establishment of the English Commonwealth, by the earliest estimations.\n\"After all, Al-Aqsa mosque and many Christian sites of great importance lie within Palestine —this does not give any one religious or ethnic group the right to reinterpret liturgical passages and religious rites as the basis for political domination and oppression, which we clearly see the Israeli state do on a daily basis — from the indescribable brutality of the bombing of Gaza, to the daily surveillance, terrorisation, and dehumanisation of Palestinians in the West Bank, occupied Palestine, and around the world.\n\"Thus, Zionism is not 'simply the belief that Jewish people have the right to a state in their ancestral homeland,' it is a racist form of ethno-nationalism; there is nothing 'simple' about a 'homeland' that is established through atrocity and the displacement of those already living in Palestine: Palestinians.\"\nThey added: \"The Jewish members of GUJPS also wish to express that political Zionism erases and voids the rich history and cultural contributions of Jews living within the UK and across the world, who do not define their identity through the state of Israel.\"\nThey said the demand to ban Zionists from campus, was \"in direct response to the repeated invitation of prominent pro-Israeli speakers, such as Michael Gove and Kerissa Khan to campus by the university, as well as companies which facilitate and profit off of Israel’s genocide, such as BAE Systems and CGI.\"\nThey said the the interpretation of the Arabic word intifada as a call to violence against Jews is \"dangerously ignorant of the word’s actual meaning of ‘shaking off’ or ‘rising up,’ and its use to describe the historical periods in which Palestinians have resisted their colonial domination and oppression by Israel.\"",

      "content_en": "Yet there I was on a Monday night earlier this month lying on a trolley bed in a corridor somewhere in Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth unable to sleep through the pain and discomfort.\nWhat seemed to start off as an annoying sinus infection turned out to be quite a significant bout of pneumonia in both my lungs.\nNot ideal to say the least but this is not a personal sob story.\nThe experience allowed an insight into the current care and waits in Scotland’s NHS.\nFrom my own care path to fellow patients’, what I found was deeply troubling.\nMy route into the belly of the beast began at a local practice.\nAfter a third trip to the GP, I was sent to ‘Glasgow’s super hospital’ and told to head for what the doctor named, ‘The Immediate Assessment Unit’.\nIt turns out this was not very immediate and it is instead called ‘Intermediate’- IAU for short. This is the route patients take when they are referred to the hospital by their GPs.\nThis was meant to provide a speedier route to care than an A & E path, according to my GP, but after experiencing both IAU and A&E waits, I’d beg to differ.\nThe waiting room is small, dark and crowded. Everyone is in a lot of pain. One man faints beside me.\nI arrive at 1.30pm and I am eventually diagnosed by a doctor and given medication at 10pm that day.\nThe waits didn’t stop there. I’m informed shortly after that I’d be sleeping in a corridor that night.\n“It’s really sh** and I’m so sorry for that,” a kind consultant candidly tells me.\nI see her dart about, making the same genuine apologies to others but it’s not her fault. This doctor is doing her best under a system that is beyond breaking point.\nDespite junior doctors desperately vying for jobs across the country, they are like gold dust here.\nIt’s the same with qualified nurses. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called the situation “ludicrous” as he told me this week he’s spoken to relatives of qualified nurses unable to find employment.\nThis rings true with what NHS staff said during my time in hospital.\nThe problem isn’t that no-one wants to do the job, it’s that there aren’t enough jobs, a consultant in the QEUH remarks.\nEducators have since told me they are worried about the future jobs opportunities for their students.\nThen there’s the glaringly obvious capacity issue.\nA doctor says they built the QEUH with roughly 1,000 less beds than it should have.\nAnother apology ensues. “We need more staff and we need more beds”, he simply puts it.\nWhat many may not know about corridor care but could very likely guess is that assessments and treatments in these zones are almost non-existent.\nIt’s a public space. Any assessments must happen behind a curtain or a private room.\nNow, I’m lucky. I’m in my late twenties and I’m not often ill. I can walk to the toilet and I don’t have other complex medical needs.\nHowever, looking around the narrow, busy space, the five other trolleys are all occupied by elderly patients. Many immobile.\nThe man in front of me is 89. My corridor buddy clearly has delirium. At 3am, he tries to steal my oxygen mask. I manage to stop him by moaning loudly for a good 30 seconds.\nAll was forgiven as backing away, the 89-year-old plops himself on his trolley and begins singing Viva Las Vegas. If you don’t laugh, you’ll cry.\nBut then there’s an upsetting aspect of his NHS journey.\nThe elderly man tries to go to the toilet on several occasions but staff won’t let him as he needs assistance. ‘He’s known for running away’, apparently.\nMy corridor buddy clearly has delirium. At 3am, he tries to steal my oxygen mask.\nBecause staff are rushed off their feet, it takes half an hour (I counted) for someone to come round and help him.\nThen there's the older woman behind me who is at high risk of having a stroke.\nAll the care she can get in her trolley is the same as mine: an oxygen tank and the occasional check-in to see if she needs painkillers. She has to wait the whole night with her daughter anxiously holding her hand.\nIn corridor care in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. (Image: staff) Despite her own health problems, her approach is incredibly similar to my late gran's stern words but kind concern.\n“That’s an awful cough you’ve got, dear. Mind and take loads of water,” she says as I pass her by following a trip to the toilet.\nWe chat for a bit and I ask her how she’s doing. She tells me she will be fine - that familiar brand of Glaswegian stoicism seeping through - but I know she’s worried. Who wouldn’t be?\nREAD MORE:\nAt the same time we were in hospital, journalists were reporting on the healthcare ordeal of 87-year-old Winifred Bolland from East Lothian.\nThe poor woman was left traumatised after waiting around 12 hours at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary’s A&E department on three separate occasions.\nHer daughter told the press her mother was “badly let down” and she couldn’t possibly survive another admission like that.\nThese stories of pain and waiting amongst the elderly and others are not rare.\nMore than 12,000 patients over the age of 85 were forced to wait in A&E for more than 12 hours last year, according to figures published by the Scottish Liberal Democrats.\nAcross all ages, data analysis by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine found the number of Scots going through the same waits surged to almost 100 times the level it was at in 2011.\nThen there’s the stark figure of a record 10,000 people who have died whilst on Scotland’s NHS waiting lists in the last year. It is understood this is likely an underestimate due to how data is collected by individual health boards.\nIn the first full week of March, there were 9,399 patients who spent longer than four hours in accident and emergency before being either admitted, transferred or discharged.\nThis includes 3,250 patients (12.1%) who were there for at least eight hours and 1,361 (5%) who were there for half a day or more.\nAlthough the recent weekly A&E waiting times show a slight increase in patients being seen, the First Minister himself admits that the waits are unacceptable.\nDespite promises that it is tackling the lists by investing £200 million, the Scottish Government is still well below meeting its target of 95% of patients in A&E admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.\nI respect John Swinney’s honesty when he admits that some patients are not getting the right care at the right time, however, acceptance is not the final stage to be reached when it comes to Scotland’s broken NHS.\nAfter nearly a week in hospital, I’m scared of the place - and I’m deeply concerned that not enough progress is being made.\nOvercapacity and waiting issues are casting a dark cloud over a health service meant to freely serve us from cradle to grave.\nTackling problems in the NHS will be legacy-defining for Mr Swinney but, far more importantly, for some patients, fixing it is a matter of life or death.",

      "content_en": "The Housing (Scotland) Bill sets out plans to make changes to the law covering rent controls, tenants’ rights and a mechanism to delay evictions under certain circumstances.\nHowever, Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman believes the Scottish Government’s current definition of domestic abuse within the context of the proposals is not broad enough to offer the necessary protections as the Greens believe it only covers violent, threatening and intimidating conduct.\nMs Chapman has lodged the changes in an amendment to the bill which would see controlling, coercive, and degrading behaviour included within the definition.\nYet, the Scottish Government has said the bill's definition of the term \"already covers the point\" Ms Chapman is raising, adding it is \"wide enough\" to capture \"physical or mental injury, fear, alarm or distress\".\nThe bill, as introduced to parliament this month, states abuse can cover \"violence, harassment, threatening conduct, and any other conduct giving rise, or likely to give rise, to physical or mental injury, fear, alarm or distress.\"\nREAD MORE:\nThe Green MSP has also lodged another amendment which would force the Scottish Government to implement findings of their December 2020 report on improving housing outcomes for women and children experiencing domestic abuse.\nMs Chapman said: “Women might feel unable to leave a violent and abusive relationship for fear of ending up homeless, and that sense of feeling trapped only increases when there are children involved in the process.\n“This bill must work to enhance the support we offer women and children, so that they are better protected and able to flee from abuse, without fear of being left homeless or placed in unsuitable and unsafe accommodation due to their experience of abuse not matching the government’s definition.\n“By expanding the definition of domestic abuse, we can help to resolve that fear and create a more hopeful future for women and their families who are rebuilding their lives.”\nThe expansion of the meaning in the bill is something which has been long called for by Scottish Women’s Aid as it would allow for the proposed legislation to be in line with the Domestic Abuse Act.\nDr Marsha Scott, the chief executive of the charity told The Herald: “These forms of abuse are among the most dangerous for women and children, yet the current definition focuses only on violent, threatening, and intimidating conduct.\n“Aligning the Bill with the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018 is essential to ensure survivors are fully protected from all forms of abuse that can lead to homelessness. No survivor should be left without the support and security they need.”\nShelter Scotland has said they welcome any proposals which they believe will \"strengthen protections\" around domestic abuse.\nTheir support comes after their joint report with Engender last year which highlighted the “devastating reality” women are faced with when met with barriers in accessing safe and secure housing.\nIt showed barriers were particularly pronounced for minoritised women including, disabled women, LGBT+ women, and women of colour.\nThe charity’s director of communications and advocacy, Gordon MacRae said: “Scotland’s housing system is not only broken but biased as well, with women being disproportionately affected.\n“We know that when it comes to housing, councils are breaking the law on an industrial scale, denying support to those who need it and are entitled to it; for a woman fleeing domestic abuse the consequences of being turned away could be utterly catastrophic, so we welcome proposals that strengthen protections around domestic abuse.”\nMinisters have said the definition in the bill already includes sufficient measures to protect domestic abuse victims, as they say protecting survivors is a \"priority\" for government.\nHousing Minister Paul McLennan said: “Domestic abuse and other forms of gender-based violence are abhorrent and utterly unacceptable and supporting victim-survivors with their housing needs continues to be a priority for this government.\n“We share Ms Chapman’s desire to protect women who are experiencing domestic abuse and are sympathetic to her proposal. However, we believe that the Housing Bill and amendments already cover the points she is raising.\n“We have introduced provisions in the Housing Bill updating the definition of domestic abuse in line with more recent domestic abuse legislation. Our current definition is wide enough to capture behaviours which give rise, or are likely to give rise, to physical or mental injury, fear, alarm or distress.\n“We look forward to working with Ms Chapman during Stage 2 to deliver a Bill that does what we all want it to do – protect women.”",

      "content_en": "Glenelg to Kylerhea\nMV Glenachulish is the last surviving manually operated turntable car ferry in the world and the five-minute passage between Glenelg and Kylerhea – which recommences for 2025 on April 1 – is a bucket list gem.\nFrom the moment you leave the A87 at Shiel Bridge and begin the drive over Mam Ratagan Pass, you can feel the history in every twist and turn of the road.\nIt was an ancient route used by drovers to take cattle to market. There are echoes too of its former incarnation as part of General Wade’s military road network, built after the 1715 Jacobite Rising.\nThere is something whimsical and romantic about sailing over the sea to Skye (rather than using the road bridge between Kyle of Lochalsh and Kyleakin). The ferry crew are rather cute too (I’m referring specifically to the resident collies, who help haul ropes).\nIf you want a pit stop to stretch your legs, there’s a lovely walk to Kylerhea wildlife hide, reputed to be one of the best places in the UK for spotting otters. The entrance to the Forestry and Land Scotland car park is only half a mile up the road from the ferry slipway.\nHoy to Graemsay\nThe 15-minute crossing between Moaness on Hoy and neighbouring Graemsay forms part of a round-trip from Stromness on the Orkney mainland.\nIf you leave early enough in the day, you can enjoy a whistle-stop tour of both islands – although do note that the MV Graemsay operates a foot passenger and bicycle service only (there are separate advertised cargo sailings for vehicles that must be pre-booked).\nHoy – as the name suggests – is home to the famed Old Man of Hoy sea stack, as well as historical sites such as Lyness Royal Naval Cemetery, Rackwick Church and the Dwarfie Stane, a rock-cut Neolithic tomb.\nGraemsay proffers not one, but two, Stevenson lighthouses – Hoy Sound Low and Hoy Sound High – built in the mid-19th century to guide herring boats through the dangerous skerries. The island was also where Orkney pirate John Gow embarked upon his final rampage in 1725.\nREAD MORE\nGourock to Kilcreggan\nYou could drive the long way round – the best part of 50 miles and roughly an hour-and-a-half by road – or you could hop across the water from Gourock to Kilcreggan in a mere 13 minutes.\nAs a busy hub of maritime activity, this stretch of the Firth of Clyde always has something interesting to see, from gargantuan cruise ships docking at nearby Greenock to the occasional submarine slinking in or out of Faslane.\nThere is usually plenty of wildlife to observe too. Keep your eyes peeled for seals, otters and, if you’re very lucky, dolphins or porpoises.\nOperated by CalMac, this is a foot passenger-only ferry. There is no Sunday service. Arrivals in Gourock link with trains to/from Glasgow Central.\nKilcreggan Pier (Image: unknown)\nCorran\nThe five-minute journey across the Corran Narrows of Loch Linnhe puts the fun in functional, linking the wider Lochaber area with communities on the Ardgour peninsula – an alternative journey by road takes around two hours.\nThe Corran Ferry, nine miles south of Fort William, is Europe’s busiest single-vessel ferry service, carrying some 270,000 cars and 11,000 commercial vehicles a year.\nIt is another that lies on an ancient drover route, a picturesque area where a smattering of classic, white-washed buildings, such as Corran Point Lighthouse and the Inn at Ardgour, are framed against a tapestry of craggy shoreline and rugged mountains.\nLerwick to Bressay\nIf you fancy a spot of island-hopping, the seven-minute ferry trip from Lerwick on the Shetland mainland to Bressay is a great start.\nFans of the Shetland books and TV show will be familiar with the myriad charms of Bressay. Its croft-dotted vistas, sites of archaeological interest and spectacular coastline making it a spellbinding place to spend time.\nBressay is the location of Shetland’s only parkrun, which can also lay claim to being the most northerly of its kind in the UK. Among its many lures is the excellent Speldiburn Cafe, renowned for its breakfast rolls, yummy soups and home-baking.\nSusan Swarbrick is a columnist and freelance writer who loves history and the outdoors.

      "content_en": "Out of the twenty or so businesses using this model in our city, eight use it through Virtual Branding accounts. These are allowed by Deliveroo Partners Policies because their menu is “substantively different” from the one from its “parent” brand.\n“Virtual Brands enable restaurant partners to expand their offer without the large investment required to open an additional venue, supporting local businesses to reach more consumers and providing additional choice for customers.”, a Deliveroo spokesperson comments.\nHowever, at least thirteen other restaurants in Edinburgh operate their ghost businesses through Duplicate Accounts, which are explicitly forbidden by Deliveroo’s policy. These are not easy to find since they can either be an exact doppelganger of its parent brand or have a completely different name and look.\nIn this article, I will guide you through the defining characteristics of Duplicate Accounts and how they differ from Virtual Brands. The previous article, “The rising trend of Scotland's 'ghost kitchens’”, explored their need for regulation. Knowing their characteristics can help you be a more informed consumer in your hunger-driven Deliveroo scroll.\nThe easy part: address and phone number\nAs consumers, it is never wrong to be thorough with our food-delivery purchases. In third-party apps like Deliveroo, Just Eat, and Uber Eats, you will find an information tab under a restaurant’s name with a Food Hygiene rating, allergen information, and an address.\nIn some cases, a Virtual Brand mentions the name of the parent restaurant. For instance, Bird Box at Ocean Terminal has “BirdBox@Frankie & Benny’s” in their address. This might be done to help delivery riders find the correct restaurant despite having a different name.\nIn the case of Duplicate Accounts, things become tricky. Deliveroo allows more than one restaurant to have the same address due to Virtual Branding, so Duplicate Accounts can easily blend in. However, some business owners do not know this and will make slight changes to their address to avoid a possible ban from the apps. In some cases, they use capital letters, remove the name of a neighbourhood, or add a range of addresses rather than just one house number.\nIf you suspect you’re about to order from a Duplicate Account, you can also look at the business phone number. Out of the thirteen found in Edinburgh, seven had the same phone number as their parent business.\nRead more:\nThe fun part: Quirky names and logos\nIf you regularly order food, you have probably laughed at some quirky restaurant names before. Some examples are Pizza Amore at The Chanter, or Eugreeka! and Wingology from The Fat Pizza. These names are distinctive of Virtual Brands, which usually have a more cohesive image with appetising pictures for every item and wrappings with their brand’s logo.\nIn Edinburgh, the names of Duplicate Accounts fall into two categories. Nine accounts have a completely different name than the parent restaurant, while the remaining four tweak the name of the parent restaurant slightly. One example is Holyrood Restaurant in Old Town, whose Duplicate Account is “Holyrood Twenty - Old Town and Canongate”.\nThe social part: reviews and popularity\nReviews matter, and not only when it comes to ratings. Parent restaurants’ accounts usually have more reviews than their Duplicate Accounts, but not necessarily a better rating. Accounts with more than 500 ratings are always the most trustworthy, and if there are no reviews or very few, it could be a duplicate.\nLastly, we also must pay attention to our surroundings and the physical world, rather than the digital. Have you seen this restaurant in the street it claims to be? Have you heard a friend or a coworker recommend it? Have you ordered from there before, and if so, what was the packaging like? These are all useful when choosing any restaurant but become crucial for identifying ghost kitchens.\nIs Deliveroo chasing Duplicates?\nDeliveroo shared for this article that they are actively working on tackling Duplicate Accounts:\n“We do not allow Duplicate Accounts on our platform, and conduct monthly sweeps to detect and remove any duplications. We are aware that a small number of Duplicate Accounts are managing to bypass these sweeps, so are currently developing further processes to prevent this which will launch later this year.”\n“All brands operating on our platform, must ensure imagery and menu information is accurate and descriptive.”\nWhile this is good news for Edinburgh, the regulation of ghost kitchens by the UK’s Food Standard Agency is still a work in progress.",

      "content_en": "Oh, all right then. But on your heads be it. I shall be as objective and dispassionate as usual when considering the Church of Scotland.\nIt’s the “national church of Scotland”. That’s why it’s getting done, as it were, here. Before you start, I’m not doing any of the others as they all, to say the least, seem over-sensitive. The great thing about Christianity in general is that you can put the boot into it and they just forgive you and even have a laugh.\nThe Kirk, today at least, neither barks nor bites. I’ve met several of its its leaders (or “moderators”; they’re a bit anarchic when it comes to leaders). Nicest people ever. Churchgoers are, generally speaking, I say again, nice. I like them. In general, I’d say I prefer a churchgoer, Catholic, Protestant, whatever, to an atheist, who thinks himself so smart (see above and, indeed, below).\nApart from anything else, you need to take people individually and not judge them in a lump, as I’ve just done with atheists. D’oh! It’s a difficult thing not to do.\nPRAY FOR SANITY\nRegarding religion, with the possible exceptions of Taoism and Buddhism (which are not strictly speaking all that theological), it’s a mystery to me how adherents believe what is obviously such cosmological piffle. But the downside of dismissing it all is that churchgoers have a social structure, purpose and calendar of activities.\nAnd, despite religion’s beginnings in sacrificing children and animals for better crops, it ended up setting down decent rules of morality. The religious also have hope and certainty, none of which your defeated and downhearted correspondent has.\nAnd so to the Church of Scotland, the Kirk, fellowship of hope and glory. Where the hell did it come from? Well, its roots lie in the Reformation of 1560 and the zeal of preacher John Knox.\nYou’ll be surprised to learn that at one time Knox played a major part in your correspondent’s life. It used to be my job to attend the Scottish Parliament twice a week during its first happy years at the Kirk’s Assembly building on the Mound. Turning up for another gruelling shift of cynical observation, I’d pass the statue of a declaiming John Knox and say cheerfully: “Morning, you curmudgeonly old scrote! ”\nBut I digress. The Kirk’s organisational approach, advocated by the aforementioned scrote, is Presbyterian, which sounds kinda democratic while, in practice, anyone identifying as such (“Aye, ah’m a right Presbyterian, me”) tends to be a roaster. At any rate, no one gets to be “head” of the faith as that role belongs to God (see “apologies for absence” in committee minutes).\nKnox’s First Book of Discipline (or Fifty Shades of Pray) argued that all the old church’s assets should pass to the new one. A system was set out whereby church elders are collectively answerable for correct practice and discipline. As you may recall from the Alexander Selkirk article in this series, offending punters would be brought before its Kirk Session in a form of Sharia Law.\nIn 1696, the Kirk was behind one of the worst acts in Scottish history when it demanded – and got – the execution of Thomas Aikenhead for blasphemy after he called religion, in the court’s words, “ill-invented nonsense”.\nIRISH STEW\nDESPITE the fact that Christianity was brought to Scotland’s shores by Irishmen, in 1923 the Kirk produced a report called The Menace of the Irish Race to our Scottish Nationality. Hmm, get some popcorn in before we read this.\nIt accused the immigrant Catholic population of subverting Presbyterian values, getting drunk, committing misdemeanours and being financially reckless. Not seeing the problem here.\nRev John White, a senior member of the General Assembly, advocated a “racially pure” Scotland. “Today,” quoth he, “there is a movement throughout the world towards the rejection of non-native constituents and the crystallisation of national life from native elements”. Crystallisation, aye.\nToday, by contrast, overcompensating for its intolerant past, the Kirk is painfully woke, tying itself in knots over alleged links to the slave trade, mainly of the “I know someone who goes to church and his auntie’s dog walker has a third cousin who bought some fags from a tobacconist and tobacco used to come from plantations” variety.\nIt opposes nuclear weapons and supports devolution. It dislikes happy endings, such as euthanasia, preferring people to suffer in agony. Irrationally biased towards life, it opposes the death penalty, which is a bit late for Thomas Aikenhead.\nIn 1992, the Kirk issued “God’s Invitation”, a statement outlining its Christianity in everyday, dumbass language. Controversially, it begins: “God made the world and all its creatures with men and women made in His image.” So it was Him! He created a horrible world where the basis of life is that everything eats everything else, baby animals are ripped apart, and everybody is ill, a place absolutely rootin-tootinly predicated on cruelty and suffering. Hats off for the pronoun, though.\nDespite all this, in 2023 the Kirk had 259,200 members, which is mental. If you went into a bar or prison and said, “Hands up who’s a member of the Kirk”, not one mitt would shoot up. Who are these people?\n(Image: Agency)\nBURY THE TRUTH\nTRUE, that number is down from 920,000 in 1982. Also, in 2019, the Scottish Household Survey found that 20% of the Scottish population, over one million people, identified with the Kirk as their religion. But that was just so they could get buried properly. Today, you just get your friendly, neighbourhood humanist to bung you into the void.\nOddly enough, while I’ll never forgive them the Aikenhead barbarity, I think the Kirk’s demise would be a sad day for Scotland.\nIf it could keep the morality and ditch the cosmology it might have a future. Then again, in future, everybody will be sitting in the hoose wearing a virtual reality headset and getting their ethics off the internet. So it probably doesn’t matter anyway.",

      "content_en": "But several questions rage as a result of BBC Scotland’s decision to end the recurring drama after 23 years; did Shieldinch deserve its Do Not Resuscitate order? There’s little argument that the storylines became darker than death, the town playing home to more murders than Capone’s Chicago. Writers were charged (and found guilty) with the task of attempting to meld human storylines with absurd plots. (Were they encouraged to watch Scorsese box sets for inspiration? Seems very likely.) Regardless, the little town became effectively a police precinct drama.\nYes, the crime and chaos content has been building over the years, the major warning shot fired when Lenny killed wife Lydia, bundled her into the boot of his car - only for Lydia to Lazarus herself some three years later and live on. Meanwhile, viewers choked on their tea cakes.\nParadoxically, however, as audience figures dropped, producers doubled down with the gangster storylines, chasing the ratings with sensationalist tales of human trafficking, gun threats and drug wars. And in doing so shot themselves in both feet.\nRead more\nAnd now we are all left wondering; did this have to happen? Could more have been done to save the recurring series which once pulled in 400k viewers a week, but has now failed to attract half that number? Probably not. Soaps are a dying format. Coronation Street and EastEnders are ailing. Neighbours were cancelled twice and will now remain in the cemetery at the bottom of Ramsay Street.\nYet, the mad, bad storylines were not what creator Stephen Greenhorn had imagined for the show back in 2002. It was about community. Connection. Family feuds and family values. River City was heightened reality, but gently heightened. It was about real people’s lives, taking the essence of kitchen sink dramas onto the screen. We loved the Tall Ship stories of crushed dreams. We loved the delight of multi-generational argument because it reflected right back at us. We loved to see couples rip each other apart because isn’t that what happens in real life?\nAnd who can forget sharp-tongued Suzie’s adventures with online dating, or Gina’s custody battle crises or Bob’s hiring of the cherry picker to take him up to the first floor of Zara’s flat when he proposed with the very best ring a backstreet car mechanic could afford. And what of the wonderful who’s-the-daddy story when he and Angus didn’t know which grease monkey had proved to be the spark plug which fired Kim into new life?\nYet, Bob’s love life is another reason why the TV soap is dead in the water. The one-time Shellsuit found himself playing out more romantic plotlines than Warren Beattie in his heyday. And because of his popularity, producers gave him even more women to fall for, be dumped/duped by – and to die on him. (Cleverly however his greatest love was recognised to be Angus, even if that relationship too was over worked). Also, a victim of success, Scarlett found herself reaching for the registry office number almost as often as Gail in Corrie.\nYet, there is little doubt that those viewers who still tuned in will miss the show. They loved Frank Gallagher’s quite immaculate performance of crime lord Lenny. They warmed to Lesley Hart’s openly gay police person character Lou. (Hart has written an episode to be screened later in the year.) Gail Watson’s Dr Gillian proved to be a dopamine booster and Barbara Rafferty (who appeared as two different characters) and Juliet Cadzow and Kath Howden have all shown that older actors can grab audiences by the neck.\nRead more\nWhich all suggests that BBC Scotland has a moral duty of care to the talented actors such as Jordan Young and Jimmy Chisholm and Joyce Falconer who have become part of the Scottish cultural psyche. It may invest the River City budget in ‘high-end drama’ but will these new series’ be co-productions? How many Scots will be involved? Will they feature non-Scots big names in order to attract the co-producers? And how many Scots writers will be involved?\nWe need to know if there will be a platform in upcoming dramas for talents such Johnny McKnight, Sergio Casci and Kim Millar. New series are always welcomed. But they tend to involve one writer.\nAnd will the new slate of series’ become water-cooler television? It’s subjective of course, but dramas coming out of the BBC haven’t always demanded that audiences give Netflix a miss and stay tuned to council telly.\nYes, Guilt and The Nest were golden tickets, and you can understand why BBC Scotland hope for a new Shetland that can be sold on overseas. And yes, psychological thriller The Ridge looks promising (if only because it’s fronted by Lauren Lyle) but what of The Young Team, a story of addictions and gang violence? Meanwhile, Granite City has been recommissioned for a third series but it’s hardly a show you can’t wait to talk to your mates about down the pub. Yellowstone it ain’t.\nBut we need to hope there is life after soap. We need to hope there is work for the crews of River City, the directors, stage designers, the canteen staff and the cleaners. And that the BBC recognises that the series was a fabulous training ground, creating learning potential ten times the size of the Dumbarton lot.\nSo, RIP River City. (Who will watch it now that its death has been announced?) And let’s hope Scotland’s drama TV future offers at least some of the colour the soap delivered in its early years. And isn’t overly gangster reliant.",

      "content_en": "The pair met back in 2003 while studying acting at Telford College in Edinburgh, neither with any real expectation of developing a career. They became friends and socialised to the full extent of their capacity. But Christopher became drug dependent. “I’m quite an anxious person,” he explains. “Going out and taking lots of alcohol was the perfect lubricant. I felt it made me more interesting. And it would help me to socialise. And at times when sitting at home at night the drugs helped me medicate the anxiety. But then before you know it, you need them. And it becomes about how you get through the day without them, rather than just the anxiety.”\nWas it also about lack of opportunity? “Not really,” he admits. “My dad was a schizophrenic and we’d gone through lots of difficulties as a family, and I hadn’t really processed any of that. I just didn’t know how to navigate life.” He adds, “My parents were estate agents, and we moved a lot. I stayed in about 15 homes before I was 16. Looking back, I’m sure that didn’t help with my stability.”\nRead more\nGraeme Smith’s early life was also far from uncomplicated. Growing up in Bonnyrigg, his parents lost their home, and he had to move schools. “Before this I was top of the class. But by the age of 15 I just felt I wasn’t academic and spent the next few years partying. But at 21 I decided to go to university.”\nMeantime, in 2019 Christopher had decided he had to change his life and gone into rehab. “When I got out, I joined a creative writing group for people in recovery, and I remembered at this point that Graeme had gone into writing in some way.”\n(Image: Tommy Ga-Ken Wan)\nIn fact, he’d completed a master’s in creative writing at Dundee University. “I was writing short stories,” Smith recalls. The pair’s friendship now took on a new (non-partying) form. They simply enjoyed spending time together. Making each other laugh. So why not write a play together?\nIt was during lockdown that the chums began throwing ideas around. They couldn’t meet up in person so the writing was done via WhatsApp, which culminated in their hugely successful play, The Schaff, about young friendships and loyalties played out via football. “Most of the play was actually written on WhatsApp,” says Smith.\nBut what of their new play? Christopher explained the genesis. “I loved the recovery group writing nights, the support system and really came to see how cathartic the time had become to everyone. It really made me itch to tell the story. And Graeme had had similar experiences.”\nSmith’s knowledge of addictions and writing came about while working in prison. “So many of the guys in there were struggling with addiction issues and I saw this on a wide scale.”\nThey played around with characters. Came up with plot lines. Christopher adds; “We didn’t want to right a classic addiction story whereby people look back at their childhood and the reasons for it all. We wanted to write something joyful that shows how life changing recovery can be.”\nRead more\nHe grins. “And have lots of big laughs in there, and dancing set pieces.”\nTheir play Dancing Shoes tells of Donny, who lives with his mum and has been struggling with addiction most of his life. He also has a secret hobby - dancing alone in his bedroom.\nDetermined to get help, Donny attends his local support group where he bonds with two other men, Jay and Craig, who change his life. But when a video of Donny dancing goes up online and makes him an accidental viral superstar, the men’s new friendship is put to the test with the whole world now watching on.\nIt’s not a play about addiction as such, but about how lives can be transformed once the addiction is conquered.\nSmith adds, smiling; “Steven really, really wanted to write about a man who loves to dance.” Christopher agrees, laughing. “I love to dance. So why not write about it?”\nDancing Shoes features Ross Allan, Stephen Docherty, Craig Mclean. A Play, Pie and a Pint, Oran Mor, Glasgow, March 24–29",

We put more than £20bn into the National Health Service.\n“That is a far cry from what we’ve seen under Conservative governments in the last 14 years.”\nAsked if there would be budget cuts to unprotected departments outside of the NHS and education, Ms Reeves said: “We’ll set all that out when we do the spending review, but we can’t just carry on like we have been spending on the same things that the previous government spent on.\n“People want to know we’re getting value for money, when people are paying more in tax that they’re getting more in return.”\nThe Chancellor confirmed plans to reduce Civil Service running costs.\n“We are, by the end of this Parliament, making a commitment that we will cut the costs of running government by 15%,” she told the BBC.\nShe said anyone running a business will think that is “more than possible” given advances in technology and AI.\n“We’re going to cut the back office functions, the administrative and bureaucracy functions.\n“The size of government increased massively during the Covid pandemic.\n“That was five years ago … but the size of the Civil Service hasn’t come back during that period. So, we now need to make sure that we do realise those efficiency savings so we can invest in the priorities.”\nDuring the interview, the Chancellor also refused to rule out slashing tax on tech giants.\nThere have been reports that the government might consider changing or ditching the Digital Services Tax, which imposes a 2% levy on the profits of firms like Facebook, in order to avoid the global tariffs that the Trump administration is planning to impose.\nAsked if this was true, Ms Reeves said the UK is in discussions \"around a whole range of things\" with the US related to tariffs.\n\"But we will continue to operate on that principle that you should pay taxes in the country in which you operate.\"\nAsked if she might tweak the tax, she said: \"You've got to get the balance right, and those discussions at the moment are ongoing.\n\"We want to make progress. We do not want to see British exporters subject to higher tariffs, and we want to see trade barriers fall right across the world.\"\nSNP Economy spokesperson Dave Doogan said Ms Reeves was a \"Tory tribute act.\"\nHe added: \"During the election campaign, Labour promised the public change from the austerity agenda of the Tories - but sticking by their self-imposed fiscal rules means more of the same for the public. Labour's promises are, in reality, worthless.\"",

Why would a country with a northern maritime climate, belching chimneys and heavy industry, with buildings blackened by soot and shrouded in smog, produce such a large and diverse array of Art Deco stretching from the industrial heartlands to places like Peterhead, with its grand 1,500-seat Regal cinema, and Rothesay with its Pavilion?\nThe observation lounge of Clyde-built floating Art Deco palace, RMS Queen Mary (Image: Bruce Peter)\nAccording to Prof. Peter, part of Scotland’s fascination with Art Deco was down to the nation’s heavy industrial past, and a desire to be seen as embracing a new modern age.\nAs Scots looked towards a brighter future with electrical gadgets at home and new industries on the horizon, its strong engineering culture meant there was both a fascination for new technology and ambition not to be left behind in the grime of their industrial roots.\n“Scottish industrialists saw the ‘up to date’ as synonymous with being successful,” he says. “If you were in any way involved in industry, you wanted to express that you were moving with the times.\nPitlochry Dam and Power Station was built in an Art Deco style (Image: Bruce Peter/HES)\n“On top of that, in Scotland there was a strong sense of being an outward-looking and cosmopolitan nation.”\nThere was also a vibrant generation of Scottish architects and designers influenced by historic links to France – ground zero for this new modern style – and the 1904 appointment of the Parisian architect Eugène Bourdon as head of the Glasgow School of Architecture.\nWhile they had one eye on France, its Beaux-Arts system and its Impressionist artists, the other was trained on the United States of America, with its towering skyscrapers.\nWell-trained and well-travelled Scottish architects worked with clients who had also experienced the world’s cosmopolitan centres of style.\nIt combined to create a ‘lightbulb’ moment: Scots were more than ready to embrace this dramatic new style.\n“There were all these influences which encouraged this type of modern work,” says Prof. Peter. “And there was a lot of it in Scotland.”\nBuilt-up conurbations at the time were dark and dirty, with buildings blackened with soot from thousands of chimneys.\nBut this new aesthetic shone like a new pin.\nAn Art Deco style home in Newton Mearns, designed by Mactaggart & Mickel, mid-1930s (Image: Bruce Peter)\nVisitors to the 1938 Empire Exhibition at Bellahouston Park were greeted by the new style in all its glory: the Tower of Empire overlooking creamy coloured buildings made from new materials like asbestos cement, a ship-shaped Atlantic Restaurant and façades of curved glass and steel.\n“The atmosphere here at the time was filthy in ways we can’t imagine. And this was an aesthetic that at the time had very broad appeal.\n“This pastel-shaded environment with all the illuminated fountains… it was a totally different world.\n“It opened up people to welcome possibilities of things being done differently and better, and the idea of cleanliness and bright colours.”\nAlso driving the craze was a new connectivity that enabled people to share trends and tap into what was happening in cosmopolitan centres like Chicago, New York and London.\nRead more Sandra Dick:\n“Talking movies and illustrated magazines made the general literate part of the public more aware of other ways of doing things in other places.\n“They had an impression that things really ought to change.”\nAs the shift began, new buildings in Art Deco style – cinemas, dance halls, department stores, car dealerships, villas and even factories – sprang up.\n“Given the climate in Scotland, there’s a tremendous number of art deco villas with flat roof villas, balconies and corner windows,” he adds.\nPortobello outdoor pool near Edinburgh was among several lidos and outdoor swimming pools designed in Art Deco style (Image: Bruce Peter/HES)\n“They look as if they should be in the Mediterranean, the south coast of England or one of the leafier suburbs of Los Angeles, but they’re in Bearsden, Newton Mearns, Kelso, Dundee, Broughty Ferry, Stranraer…\n“Everywhere you go, you see another one.\n“This new development was generally welcomed; it was a sign of progress and change.”\nIndustrial buildings also embraced the style, such as Scotland’s first modern industrial estate at Hillington, a unique project in the second half of the 1930s which used electricity rather than coal power, making it a beacon for a cleaner future.\nA response to the impact of the Great Depression on Clydeside’s heavy engineering-based economy, it was intended to show a bright future away from the “dark Satanic mills” of the Industrial Revolution, looking towards new industries of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and household goods.\nThe new book, Art Deco Scotland, includes more than 400 photographs and illustrations from the Historic Environment Scotland archives.\nLothian House, in Lothian Road, Edinburgh, features boldly detailed stonework surrounding its many window bays (Image: Bruce Peter)\nThe accompanying exhibition, in the Reid Gallery Corridor at The Glasgow School of Art and part of events celebrating Glasgow’s 850th anniversary, will bring together images, ephemera, a film and textual interpretation covering Art Deco style in Scotland.\nA key piece will be an animated 3D model of the Empire Exhibition, alongside examples of Scotland’s best-loved Art Deco buildings including Bathgate’s Regal Cinema and the Paramount Cinema, Glasgow.\nThe Regal cinema in Bathgate, one of many Art Deco styled cinemas that sprang up around Scotland (Image: Bruce Peter)\nBoth the exhibition and book also highlight the impact of leading Scottish architects of the time, who didn’t just apply the style at home, they exported it.\nSuch as Sir John Burnet’s architecture firms in Glasgow and London, which played a pivotal role in defining the look of interwar London with designs for Adelaide House, the tallest building in the city at the time, Selfridges department store with its ornate entrance canopy, and Kodak House, with its American-style modern frontages.\nThey were so influential that they produced a detailing guide which was adopted by almost every other architectural firm.\nAs well as working with the practice and contributing to projects from New Zealand to Johannesburg, Paisley-born Thomas S. Tait, the creative force behind Adelaide House, was also involved in designing the Daily Telegraph building in Fleet Street, the grand portals of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and St Andrew’s House in Edinburgh.\nSt Andrew's House in Edinburgh was designed in Art Deco style by Thomas S. Tait (Image: Scottish Government)\nAnother key figure, Glasgow-trained James Steel Maitland, designer of Paisley’s Russell Institute, brought experience from his time in North America bringing international insight to his designs.\nFor all its glamour, however, Art Deco was not always practical in Scotland. Flat roofs, perfect for sun-drenched locales, were less suited to relentless drizzle, and architects often had to tweak designs to reflect the climate.\nIt also took a leap of faith for Scottish homemakers to swap heavy, and dark soft furnishings that hid fireplace soot for the brighter fabrics from the likes of Edinburgh Weavers, the funky linoleum of Kirkcaldy’s Michael Nairn & Co, and Templeton’s abstract carpet designs.\nA bedroom suite produced by Kirkcaldy cabinetmakers A H McIntosh (Image: Bruce Peter/The Cabinet Maker)\nBut while Art Deco thrived in the new electric age, Scotland’s love affair with it would eventually be swamped by new trends. Buildings which once dazzled in grim city streets lost their shine. More often than not, they were eventually demolished.\nSome survivors are being coaxed back to life: Rothesay Pavilion, closed since 2015, recently received final funding to help restore it to past glory.\nOthers, like the former Leyland Motor Co. building in Glasgow’s Salkeld Street, languish on the Buildings at Risk Register.\nThe former Leyland Motor Co. building in Glasgow's Salkeld Street (Image: ichard Sutcliffe and licensed for reuse under creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)\nProf. Peter hopes by shining new light on Scotland’s Art Deco romance what’s left can be better appreciated and protected for future generations to admire.\n“One of the things that I find utterly vexing at the moment is the terrible neglect of so many of our great buildings, particularly in Glasgow but also in other places,” he adds.\n“I hope the book will draw attention to the great work that the body of Scottish architecture represents.”\nArt Deco Scotland: Design And Architecture In The Jazz Age by Bruce Peter is published by Historic Environment Scotland. An accompanying exhibition of the same name runs from 5 – 28 April at Reid Ground Floor Corridor, Glasgow School of Art.",

      "content_en": "Her friend Natalie Blue replies: “I haven’t been to a shop in 2025. I’ve been out once this entire year.”\nRebecca Smith – who asked for a pseudonym to be used to preserve her family’s privacy – adds: “My mental health was in the toilet. I had to reach out for help. I was so low. I don’t want to go into it all, as my kids are around, but I was the lowest you can get.”\nThe three women are painting a picture of what it’s like to be the parent of a child with additional support needs. They run the organisation Empower:ED Scotland, which campaigns for ASN families.\nASN families say they’re in the middle of a crisis. The number of children with conditions like autism is soaring, while school resources dwindle. Disabled people are in the cross hairs of the Labour government’s austerity programme. Discrimination is rising, and ASN children are increasingly blamed for violence in society and schools.\n“The temperature has dropped,” says Lamond, who worked for years as a learning disability nurse. “Winter is coming. It’s getting dark out there for children like ours.”\nLamond’s daughter has autism. Like most ASN children, her daughter is meant to attend mainstream school. It’s what is known as “inclusion” – the policy of educating ASN pupils alongside other children.\nBut like many ASN parents, Lamond says mainstream education failed her daughter. “Her education broke down. She was out of school for years. The school environment just didn’t meet her needs.”\nBlue’s six-year-old son also has autism. Due to the “trauma” he experiences by attending mainstream school he can appear disruptive to other pupils and teachers. He’s been out of school for more than a year.\nSmith’s child is autistic as well. The nursery he attended told her “they simply couldn’t handle him any more and we had to find other provision”. School has become nightmarish. He’s “pre-verbal”, which means “he can’t formulate his own sentences”.\nAttending mainstream primary school has “traumatised” him, Smith says.\nLamond set up the ASN campaign “because of the powerlessness we felt as parents”. There’s a “huge power differential”, she says, between parents and teachers and officials. “We wanted to challenge local authorities and government.”\nThe system which caters for ASN children in schools “is a shambles”. The Scottish Government knows exactly how bad matters are, Lamond says, as it staged an inquiry into additional support learning. “They got all this evidence but nothing happened.”\nASN children are “pushed into the mainstream”, Lamond adds. But children like her daughter just “aren’t able to cope in a mainstream setting. They suffer sensory overload. It can be hell on Earth for them”.\nOutburst\nASN children can be completely overwhelmed by the sounds, smells, and whirl of activity in mainstream schools. That can trigger behavioural outbursts. The education of the rest of the pupils can suffer as a consequence.\nLamond, and the other parents favour the creation of “intermediate schools”. These would provide a halfway house between special schools for children with profound needs and mainstream schools. But when it comes to intermediate schools, “there’s nothing like that in Scotland”, Lamond adds.\nPatrick Kieran is also part of the campaign. His son is five and autistic. He wants his child to attend an intermediate school. “The risk is if he goes to mainstream it will be beyond the scope of his ability and it’ll come crashing down and fall to pieces. Then you have a situation where the child is traumatised and it puts them off education for life.”\nHe fears that if his son was sent to a special school for children with “profound disabilities and challenging behaviour” it might cause him to “regress. So we’re stuck between a rock and a hard place”.\nKieran adds: “The Scottish Government has this presumption that all children should be educated within mainstream school. The idea of inclusivity is all well and good, but the reality is there are some children who need support over and above what mainstream provides.\n“While all these platitudes are nice –that everybody is equal – the world isn’t like that. We’re supposed to be giving children an education which ties in with their needs and abilities. We should push them to reach their potential, but we shouldn’t do that in a way that’s detrimental to their health and wellbeing.\n“Shoving kids into mainstream school because it’s cheaper is easy.”\nHe accepts that finding money to pay for intermediate schools is difficult, “but it’s a discussion as a society which we must have”.\nAs the situation stands, parents find “the pathway through the education system horrendous … It’s hard enough being the parent of an autistic child as your life changes in ways you can’t imagine. Then on top of that you have to fight the system. It’s draining”.\nAn astonishing 40.5% of pupils – that’s 284,448 children – have additional support needs in Scotland. The number has doubled since 2014. Meanwhile, the number of ASN teachers has fallen. In 2013, each ASN teacher supported 40 pupils. By 2023, the ratio was one to 89.\nBlue describes the system as “shambolic”. It took from January to September last year to assemble a multidisciplinary meeting about her son’s education and inability to attend school. An occupational therapist and educational psychologist were assigned but still haven’t met with her son. In addition, there is a nurse, social workers, and council officers.\n“But he’s still out of school. It’s a box-ticking exercise.” She doesn’t blame the individual teachers or other professionals. “They’re lovely people, it’s a systemic problem.”\nBlue says she just wants her son to get an education. “He’s got no friends,” she adds.\nSmith is a teacher – which is why she wants to remain anonymous – so knows the system from the inside. Every parent of an ASN child “has to put on boxing gloves”, she says. “You don’t stop fighting.”\nIsolated\nCOUNCIL inclusion officials suggested her son “should be isolated” while in nursery, and “shouldn’t be integrating with the main population – who at the time included his little brother”. Her son was toilet trained but after his experience of mainstream education that unravelled and he now regularly “has accidents. That’s just one example of the trauma that mainstream did to him”.\nWithin months of her son entering primary school, an educational psychologist as well as the deputy head and his class teacher told Smith “this isn’t the place for him”. But there’s no other option available.\nShe also doesn’t blame the professionals she’s encountered. It’s simply a case that mainstream schools are limited in what they can do. “The staff have gone above and beyond in every way they can, but it’s not enough.”\nSmith also favours the creation of intermediate schools for ASN pupils. Her son’s school has a language and communication base – intended for ASN children – but due to the number of children with special needs only those with the most “profound” conditions have been prioritised and given one of the few places in the base.\nKieran says that it’s not a question of ASN children “failing mainstream school, rather mainstream school has failed them”.\nMainstream schools are often designed in ways that exacerbate the problems ASN children face. A simple matter like Christmas can be deeply upsetting for autistic children. The pattern of the days change, brightly coloured trees are put up, there’s loud singing, parties, Santa appears. These can all be incredibly stressful for children not suited to mainstream school.\nKieran says “we need to rethink this presumption that we mainstream educate all children. Obviously, we should try and include them. That might look like a hybrid model, where children with additional support needs go to an intermediate school for part of the day and mainstream for the rest”.\nEvidently, as numbers of ASN children rise, resources must rise accordingly. “I see no evidence of provision growing,” he says.\n“If anything it’s shrinking.”\nLamond believes that the system “is making children unwell at the cost of an inclusion ethos”.\nCuts\nSTATE support for disabled people is to be cut by £5 billion. The Labour government is under attack from backbenchers, unions and disability charities who say this will push disabled people deeper into poverty. Parents of ASN children fear the financial impact.\nUK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has been criticised for claiming there is an “overdiagnosis” of mental health conditions.\nLamond said such comments and the cuts are “all part of the stigmatising of disabled people, the language used is full of stereotyping, othering, demonising and marginalisation”.\nParents, she says, “live in fear of the future for their children”.\nCutting support makes it appear as if “the society you live in doesn’t truly value your existence” and that it’s “okay for disabled people to live in poverty”.\nFamilies of ASN children “live much more basic lives, a more meagre life as befits our position in society which is undoubtedly as ever at the bottom”. Social attitudes are “dehumanising and Dickensian”.\nShe adds: “Loss of income decreases your quality of life and increases the stress for the family, particularly single-parent families. As my child isn’t in school, I also have increased costs of them being at home, and trying to provide the activities that support their meagre educational experience.”\nLamond “feels abandoned by the state, which has become cruel. These attitudes have permeated into services which are the gatekeepers of support. It’s an incredibly challenging position as a parent to find yourself in”.\nThe Labour government “has belittled the disabled community”. The disabled are seen as “easy targets” due to claims that they are “faking it to live in luxury – and that’s not true”.\nHer child doesn’t even want to “disclose her diagnosis for fear of judgement”.\nLamond questions why there wasn’t “fairer taxation of the wealthy” rather than cuts. Due to NHS waiting lists, ASN children “are being left without the early intervention that’s proven to improve long-term outcomes”.\nShe adds: “As a result, too many young people with ASN face a future of increased dependency, not because of their conditions, but due to systemic failures in education, healthcare, and employment support that’s set them up for economic failure.\n“Instead of penalising the most vulnerable, the government must focus on creating inclusive policies that provide genuine opportunities for all.”\nLamond pointed to research by ADHD UK which rebuts claims that mental health issues are overdiagnosed. It found that ADHD was actually underdiagnosed in Britain.\nKieran said that as “parents of ASN children are already poor”, the government had chosen to “make the poor poorer”. Parents of children with ASN incur greater costs and also need to spend more time at home caring for children which impacts their earning power.\nBlue said claims of overdiagnosis “ignore the reality that many people struggle to even access a diagnosis due to long waiting lists”. She added that “removing essential support will likely lead to increased crises, higher demand on the NHS and ultimately greater costs to the government in the long run. Instead of investing in proper support systems these cuts seems to punish those who need help the most.\n“It feels like the concerns from disabled people are being ignored entirely and their fate is in the hands of people who don’t value their views or needs.”\nDiscrimination\nDISCRIMINATION is rampant, the parents believe. The very notion of “inclusion” needs questioned, Lamond feels. “Exclusion is a society-wide issue,” she says. “That can’t be fixed by throwing all the kids in together and hoping that in 20 years there will be an inclusive society.”\nHer first experience of exclusion didn’t come from the school system but other parents. To many ASN parents, inclusion is a “joke” as the sense of exclusion is socially pervasive.\nIn terms of education, the policy of inclusion will only work, Lamond believes, when schools are properly equipped to provide the level of support ASN children need.\nSo, is she saying the policy of inclusion is good in theory but a disaster in practice? “Yes.” Blue replies: “I agree. It’s not working.” Blue would be happy for her child to be educated in mainstream school if he was adequately supported. “But he’s not supported.”\nSmith, who has taught in special schools, says there’s a big difference between the educational needs of ASN children and children in special schools who are “wheelchair-bound or deaf and blind”.\nASN children, she adds, “aren’t special enough for special schools, and not mainstream enough for mainstream”.\nThe way inclusion operates now means that no child wins, the group feels. Some ASN kids can be traumatised and left exhausted by the overstimulating nature of mainstream schools. Non-ASN pupils can suffer from the major disruption caused in class and the demand on limited resources.\nChristmas is again used an example. It upsets many ASN kids but is loved by other kids. “It epitomises the conflict in mainstream education,” Lamond adds.\nSmith says that “grief comes with finding out your child has additional support needs. It’s almost like the child I envisioned had died or gone. You compare your kid to other kids”.\nBlue has set up a podcast so parents of ASN children can share such painful feelings. “There’s quite a community of us,” she says. “A lot of parents feel they’re being gaslit by schools. Children are set up to fail. My son can’t draw, read or write.\n“People say to me ‘why don’t you homeschool’. I’m not a teacher. I’ve no idea how to teach. I can’t get his shoes on some days, so how am I going to teach him to read and write? I don’t have those skills.”\nBlue’s son has what’s called pathological demand avoidance (PDA), a condition often linked to autism. Superficially, it’s a refusal to obey instructions, but it’s triggered by children becoming overwhelmed by the environment around them.\nBlue’s son was with her during this interview, and became so distressed briefly that there was a risk he’d break her iPad. “He gets so worked up, upset and anxious that he’ll fling something because he doesn’t know how to cope.”\nDisruptive\nIN school, PDA can lead to children throwing chairs or other disruptive behaviour. “It’s probably the main reason that primaries are getting much higher incidences of behaviour that’s challenging,” Lamond adds.\n“It’s what happens when kids are so dysregulated that they’re in flight or fight mode. Teachers aren’t equipped. They don’t get the training.”\nThe sort of discipline that would work on a child without ASN won’t work on a child with ASN.\n“It actually kicks them off,” Lamond explains. The de-escalation techniques required are too complex for mainstream teachers. No teacher can do that when they’ve got 30 kids in front of them,” Lamond says.\nSmith says she taught in a school where a special needs assistant clearly had no training in dealing with autistic children. “Her lack of knowledge was very evident.”\nShe gave this analogy for PDA: “It’s like when you’re trying to make dinner, and the kids are asking for stuff, and you’ve one thing boiling and another coming out of the oven, and your husband comes in and goes ‘put the kettle on’ and that simple request can just make you explode because you’re like ‘hold on, look at everything I’m doing!’.\n“That’s PDA for kids. They’re too busy controlling the environment – juggling noise, smells, everything that triggers them. They’re just trying to exist and you give them this little request and it just spins them.”\nThe parents warn that inadequate training for teachers can exacerbate health issues, such as children avoiding food. The parents report some children not eating for up to two months while at school.\nMainstream society knows very little about ASN. For example, autistic children who wear earphones, Smith explains, aren’t just protecting themselves from noise.\nMany autistic children experience pain from loud noises.\nBlue says that the notion of ASN children “building up resilience is ridiculous”. ASN kids are effectively in “an environment that’s impossible for them”.\nLamond’s daughter experienced “autistic burnout” due to the school environment. Expecting her to return to class was “like throwing bombs at war veterans”. The system is so broken, the group says, that reform can only come from “the top down”.\nHowever, the Scottish Government “claims ‘our laws are child-friendly, and all your needs will be met’. But that’s not true,” Lamond adds.\nBlue called her podcast ‘No Problems Here’, satirising the response of the system to parental concerns. Asked to sum up the state’s approach, she replies: “It’s bull***t.”\nLamond says the Scottish Government has been presented with mountains of evidence that the system isn’t working. “What will it take? It’s like we’re howling at the Moon.” She points out that the Children and Young People’s Commissioner has strongly criticised ASN education in Scotland.\nSmith says that many ASN children “mask” while in school. They pretend to cope “as they’re so keen to be seen as ‘normal’ and in line with their peers. But when they get home they’re just burned out. It’s the Coke bottle effect”.\nEvery time a child is exposed to some overwhelming stimulus “the bottle gets shaken”. When they get home, the bottle explodes.\nUnhappy\nLAMOND says the life of ASN parents can be hard. “I’ve been incredibly lonely,” she explains. “You’re isolated. There’s a lot of truth in the claim that you’re only as happy as your unhappiest child.”\nShe lost her job and home as she had to devote her life to her child’s needs. “Our whole society is built on kids going to school. If they’re not going to school, then you’re not going to work. It’s been the most disempowering experience of my life.” Until she set up the campaign, she was “completely lost. But now this is our fightback”.\nBlue says her son doesn’t want to leave the house. He has just emerged from “a burnout episode, even without school. The last two years have been awful. He doesn’t sleep so I’m always tired”.\nShe adds: “I used to be a social butterfly.” Now she doesn’t go out any more. “It’s become my norm, but it’s not most people’s norm and it wasn’t my old norm.”\nSmith says she feels “constantly judged”. Like many parents of ASN children, she says her son is regularly not invited to parties. “It’s so common, it happens all the time.” She’s had parents talking about her son in front of her.\nLamond adds that she’d “be rich if I got a pound for every micro-aggression we experience and the free advice we get like ‘if they were mine’ or ‘if I was you’ or ‘I’d soon sort them out’. You feel responsible when you’re hearing that all the time”.\nWhen reports emerge of children going to school in nappies, ASN parents are regularly called “the scum of the Earth”. Lamond adds: “This is around us constantly. We’re not welcome. For some reason this ableism is tolerated.”\nExtremist rhetoric is growing, particularly online, where ASN children are called “uneducable” or claims are made like “does it really matter if an autistic child gets an education?”. Lamond adds: “It’s terrifying. We’re going backwards.” Some of the comments she sees online read like “fascist eugenics”.\nBlue takes none of these attacks lying down. When people make judgements or try to tell her how to raise her child, she tells them: “Why don’t you educate yourself and p**s off. You can’t argue with stupid.”\nShe’s had people suggest that tests be run during pregnancy and if conditions like autism are found then the child should be aborted. “Should autistic people not be here?” she asks.\nLamond says that “an attached cost” has now been placed on ASN children. They’ve been “attached” to disruption, challenging behaviour in schools, violence in the classroom, and violence in society. “It’s classic scapegoating,” she says – and it makes her fear there are those who want to “remove them from society”.\nLamond believes attitudes began to “chill about 15 years ago”, after the financial crash. Blue and Lamond say they believe there’s a large genetic component to the rise in conditions like autism. A number of people in Lamond’s family, for instance, are neurodivergent. Like many parents of ASN children, Blue is now waiting to be checked herself.\nViolence\nTHE group claims data held by the state on ASN children is “shabby”. It’s unclear, they claim, how many children are missing from school due to conditions like autism. Sometimes incidents are recording as violent when they’re relatively minor.\nBlue says a five-year-old autistic girl asked for her clementine orange to be peeled. The teacher was busy and didn’t respond so the child “flung the clementine”. Nobody was hurt but “it was recorded as a violent incident with a weapon”. The child was allegedly restrained.\nViolent offending by autistic teens has been brought into sharp focus by events such as the Southport killings and an attack which saw a child thrown from the balcony of the Tate Modern.\nLamond says that a young relative of hers was “sexually assaulted by an older autistic boy” so offending “clearly” happens. However, she also believes that the correct support has not been put in place to prevent such offending.\n“Statistically,” she says, “autistic people aren’t dangerous.” She feels they are scapegoated in a similar way to people with schizophrenia. She says: “Neurodiverse people and people with learning difficulties are more likely to be the victim of crime. And just look at the statistics for autistic people who commit suicide or self-harm.”\nSmith explains that sometimes her son’s behaviour “can be violent. He’d lash out, he might fit or bite. In mainstream school, the staff didn’t understand”. She says what appears to be “bad behaviour” is actually a distressed child with a mental health condition trying to communicate that they are upset.\nStressing that she is “not justifying” acts of violence which have been committed, she adds that the vast majority of ASN children “aren’t being violent for the sake of trying to hurt or harm you. They’ve become so dysregulated that they cannot control themselves”.\nSmith says that disruptive behaviour proves the problems inherent in mainstream education for ASN children. “You’re taking your child into a place that’s causing them trauma and they never get the chance to recover. That’s got to have a massive mental impact. People can’t develop or learn when they’re in a state of flight or fight. You can’t function as your brain interprets all sorts of things as danger.”\nThe effects of war or abusive relationships are similar, she says, to “what’s happening to our children just because we’re sending them into school. We need to prevent trauma”. To her, intermediate schools for ASN children “would be the prevention”.\nInstead, her child isn’t coping in mainstream school and the resources assigned to help him could be “used on other children” if he was in an intermediate school.\n“He’s not learning, he’s not thriving, he’s literally just surviving in that school. If he was in a different place, the learning assistant could be allocated to someone with dyslexia, and that pupil would be able to thrive as opposed to not getting the resources.\n“Across the board, everybody would benefit. We know the system is at breaking point. There’s no way we can just continue with things as they are and expect it to suddenly get rosy. That’s the definition of madness.”\nBlue adds that from a simple economic perspective intermediate schools would therefore be more “cost-effective”.\nUnless there’s a change, then society “will have to build more prisons”, she says, adding: “That’s not a joke. If these children have no opportunity to learn and gain self-esteem, you’re going to destroy them and where do they go from there? You’re going to have an epidemic of adults who can’t live alone.”",

And it really shouldn't be this way.\"\nA Scottish Forestry spokesperson said it has \"funding to support around 10,000 ha of new woodland, which is still a reputable amount and will be more than the other countries of the UK combined\".\nThe spokesperson continued: \"In the past five years we’ve had to be content with Covid, Brexit, one of the most vicious storms in the last 10 years, and a very tough budget settlement.

      "content_en": "Trump has form in this area having started by introducing tariffs during his last term in office. This ended a multi-decade decline in tariffs as investors benefitted from globalisation. It appears that tailwind has disappeared; at least for now.\nIf there is one thing investors hate it is uncertainty and at this point it is hard to know what Trump’s tactics are. Is he simply using tariffs and the treat of tariffs as a bargaining tool? In which case the imposition of tariffs may be short lived and withdrawn once he has got what he wanted.\nAre they a means to raise taxes? In the medium term this may be effective, but consumers and suppliers will change their behaviour to avoid tariffs; so, they are not effective at raising significant funds for very long. For example, companies might start to manufacture goods in the US to avoid the tariffs. Perhaps this is Trump’s aim although it will take years for this to happen.\nRead more:\nWhen governments impose tariffs, the immediate reaction in the stock market is often negative. Companies that rely on importing goods or exporting products may face higher costs, leading to reduced profit margins. For example, US tariffs on Chinese goods, particularly in recent trade disputes, raised costs for American manufacturers who rely on affordable imports. Investors, anticipating lower profits for these companies, may sell off shares, causing stock prices to drop. Similarly, companies that export goods may see reduced demand for their products if tariffs raise prices overseas, which can hurt their stock value also.\nThere is also the effect on inflation to consider. Often when there is a sudden rise in inflation, say due to a rapid increase in the price of oil, outbreak of war or in this case trade tariffs the reaction of the central bank may be to cut interest rates to counteract the impact on the economy. This might have worked in the past, however with high inflation still fresh in consumers' minds it is likely that companies will pass on cost increases and workers will be very quick to demand higher incomes. This will leave central banks in a quandary, and they are likely to delay any movement on interest rates until a clear picture emerges.\nHowever, the impact of tariffs is not always uniformly negative. In some cases, specific industries or companies can benefit from tariffs. For instance, if a government imposes tariffs on foreign goods, domestic producers may see an increase in demand for their products as consumers seek alternatives. This can drive up the stock prices of companies that stand to gain from reduced foreign competition. For example, US steel manufacturers benefited from tariffs on imported steel, leading to a temporary boost in their stock prices.\nUltimately, the effect of tariffs on stock markets is complex and depends on several factors, including the scope of the tariffs, the industries involved, and the broader economic context. While tariffs can create immediate market turbulence, their longer-term impact often hinges on how governments and businesses adapt to the new trade environment.\nInvestors closely monitor tariff-related news, as shifts in trade policy can have lasting effects on market dynamics. At times like this it pays to remain well diversified as the uncertainty means that it can be difficult to pick the winners and losers.\nDavid Thomson is chief investment officer of VWM Wealth",

I just wanted to take 30 seconds tonight to say from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all your support.”\nMs Sturgeon’s book, for which she negotiated a £300,000 advance from publisher Pan MacMillan, will be called Frankly.\nMs McDermid said people had assumed she was writing Ms Sturgeon’s memoir.\n“If that was true it would be funnier,” she added. “It would have more jokes.”\nMs Sturgeon replied: “Boris Johnson is in it.”\nThe two were joined onstage by the comedian Ashley Storrie and writer Christopher Brookmyre.\nMs Storrie, the daughter of comic Janey Godley who died in November, talked about her mum’s pandemic voice overs of Ms Sturgeon’s press conferences.\nShe said: “Sometimes my mum would ask ‘what do you think he sounds like?’”\nShe then put on a nasally voice, and added: “Just a wee wee man.”\n“Was that Douglas Ross?” Ms Sturgeon asked.\nMs Sturgeon asked Mr Brookmyre about a passage in his 2004 novel, Be My Enemy, where a character said: “do you know how many times I’ve sat in a press conference and heard Nicola Sturgeon call for a minister to resign? I think she must say it in her sleep.”\n“You’ve been holding a grudge for 21 years?” Ms McDermid asked her friend.\n“You have no idea how many grudges I’ve been holding,” Ms Sturgeon replied.\nAt one point Ms McDermid told her friend: \"Don’t give up the day job.\"\n“That train might have left the station,\" Ms Sturgeon replied. \"You never know, I might change my mind. \"\nThe comment was met with cheers and applause from the audience.\n“For the benefit of all of the journalists in the room, that was a joke,” Ms Sturgeon said.\nNicola Sturgeon and Val McDermid (Image: Jane Barlow/PA) Someone in the audience then shouted out something about Ms Sturgeon being “our Queen”, which prompted Ms McDermid to tell her friend: “I still think you let us down over the Queen though.\n\"When she died, you should have hung on to her and said you don’t get the Queen back until you give us another referendum.”\n“Those were the bits you’re not meant to read out,” Ms Sturgeon said.",

      "content_en": "But beyond her medical work, she had another passion - one that would capture the very essence of island life in a way few others could.\nWith a keen eye and a camera in hand, she documented the rhythms of daily existence, capturing islanders at work and at family gatherings, building an extraordinary photographic record that offers a rare glimpse into a faded way of life.\nDr Garvie's photographs captured daily life in North Ronaldsay (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\nBut as well as taking photographs, her meticulous methods – rooted in her medical training – meant she also kept records of the people, places and events she caught on film, even the cameras and films she used, making her work a unique collection that tells an evocative story of North Ronaldsay life.\nAnd while some photographers may have been tempted to train their lens on the wild Orkney scenery or its bountiful nature, Dr Garvie’s focus was on the people.\nUnlike the stiffly posed studio portraits of the time, her unique relationship as their doctor and fellow islander meant her images showed her subjects without any hint of self-consciousness, relaxed and spontaneous, whether strapping a cow into a harness and lifting it onto a steamer, tying ‘baunds’ of barley or tending to their seaweed eating sheep.\nWhen Dr Garvie died, islanders – conscious of the value her photographs had in capturing their rapidly changing way of life – requested nine albums of images be returned to North Ronaldsay.\nBut while her photographs are recognised as an important record of island life, much less was known about the enigmatic Dr Garvie: what had led her to Orkney, what drove her passion for photography and the journey she had taken to become the island’s doctor?\nNow fascinating elements of her life have been unravelled by artist and researcher Fiona Sanderson who, having found the ghostly image of her own grandmother in one of Dr Garvie’s photographs, embarked on a journey to discover more about the extraordinary woman behind the camera.\nFiona Sanderson's grandmother photographed by Dr Garvie (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\nSince 2020 she has worked with islanders to rediscover the story of Dr Garvie and her photography; leading to a new body of collaborative work and an exhibition which showcases some of her exceptional photographs of island life.\nWhat began as a lockdown project has also uncovered details of how Dr Garvie paved the way for others in her medical career, put her own health at risk to serve others and, with her partner, Charlotte, was warmly welcomed by the community she served.\nAmong the hundreds of photographs Dr Garvie took during her 16 years as North Ronaldsay’s GP was the one showing Fiona’s grandmother as a young woman in the yard of the family’s South Ness croft.\nMembers of researcher Fiona Sanderson's family including her father pictured in his mother's arms (left) (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\nDressed in her summer clothes, she is caught standing in a barrel, shin deep in water, eyes cast downwards as she pummels her laundry with her feet.\nPiles of blankets lie in front of her, behind her is a rundown building, minus its roof. Dr Garvie captioned it simply: “Jenny South Ness, tramping the blankets”, transposing her surname for her location.\nFiona recalls the impact the photograph had and how it inspired her to delve deeper into Dr Garvie’s own life.\n“I couldn’t believe I could find pictures of my family and my grandmother as a young woman at the croft in North Ronaldsay,” she says.\n“I grew up hearing stories of the island, and they were always very important to me. Being able to put pictures to these stories became possible through the Garvie photographs.\n“She was there for 16 years, and she was part of the community.\n“In the pictures we see the self-sufficiency and pride islanders have in their lives. You can see their lives made a great deal of sense - that’s not romanticising it, because they had hard lives.\n“You can see how hard the women worked; apart from keeping the family together they were working in the fields alongside the men.\nDr Garvie captured images of women at work in North Ronaldsay's fields (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\n“Documenting women’s lives was a really important part of Dr Garvie’s work.”\nBut, she realised, only snippets of Dr Garvie’s own life were known.\n“On island, it was known she worked in India. She wore jodhpurs, she had lots of Indian things in her bungalow like brass ornaments which she gave to children on the island when she left.\n“It sounded like she came straight from India to North Ronaldsay.”\nRead more by Sandra Dick:\nA distinctive 1930s image of Dr Garvie in her jodhpurs and Fair Isle sweater, looking as if she might already be in her fifties at the time, led Fiona to wonder just when she might have qualified as a doctor.\nIt led her to records which showed she was one of Scotland’s pioneering and earliest women doctors, one of the first to qualify in 1895 through the Triple Qualification - a degree open to women and endorsed by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow.\nIt meant she could work as a doctor, yet there were still few openings available to women like her.\nWillie Swanney of Holm pictured by Dr Garvie burning kelp (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\nIt led Perth-born Dr Garvie to work in fever hospitals, where she treated tuberculosis patients at risk to her own health.\n“She worked in Glasgow, in the Midlands, Islington in London, mostly as a TB officer which seemed to be one of the career options for women doctors,” adds Fiona.\n“Unfortunately, many got ill because of the work they were doing.”\nNorth Ronaldsay children John and Bertie Thomson pictured in front of Dr Garvie's bicycle (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\nHer role screening returning First World War soldiers for TB led to her highlighting the need for similar efforts to protect their wives and children.\nAn active supporter of suffrage, Dr Garvie also turned attention to the impact of poverty on public health, working in the face of prejudice and sometimes with her recommendations for improvements and better care, either turned down or ignored.\nLater, as a medical missionary working for the Church of Scotland in India, she encountered vastly different challenges but maintained her fierce commitment to public health.\n“All her career she championed the under privileged,” adds Fiona.\n“After coming back from India, she gave a series of talks around Scotland about being a medical missionary and we know she came to Orkney years before she came here to work.\n“She was well-travelled but she was never as settled as she was in North Ronaldsay.”\nShe arrived with a remarkable set of experiences, her past evident in the Indian ornaments she kept in her bungalow and her favoured jodhpurs.\nBut despite her adventurous past, Dr Garvie laid down roots on the island and remained for 16 years, living in a bungalow with her housekeeper and partner, Charlotte Tulloch, a North Ronaldsay islander.\nDr Garvie incorporated movement in her photographs giving them a natural feel (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\nThey were times when same sex relationships were less open than today, but that did not appear to faze locals.\n“It obviously was not a problem,” says Fiona, “and it’s an important layer to her story.\n“In a small community, you have to get along with people and in some ways give people respect to be who they are.”\nA sign of how embedded she was in the community can be seen by her appearing in group and family photographs, often alongside babies and children whose births she would have attended.\nSome families appear regularly, including Charlotte’s family, suggesting the women’s relationship was warmly accepted.\nTwo North Ronaldsay women at work in fields, tying 'baunds' pictured by Dr Garvie (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\nMany of Dr Garvie’s images show islanders involved in daily tasks: women working in the fields alongside men, children playing, families gathered for special occasions.\nWhile they appear entirely natural, Fiona says Dr Garvie’s records show she paid enormous attention to her photographic work, often planning in detail so she could capture certain events – such the construction of a new roof on a local bakery and the first plane to land on the island.\nComposition was important to her too, many of her images are perfectly framed, while she incorporated movement into her photographs, with islanders’ hands often blurred as they go about their work.\nRead more by Sandra Dick:\n“She thought through her camera angles, or used more than one camera to capture it all,” Fiona adds. “She was a highly skilled photographer.”\nDr Garvie and Charlotte left the island together in 1946. Dr Garvie was living in Castlebrae, in Auchterarder, when she died, aged 83, in 1956.\nHundreds of images from her North Ronaldsay albums have now been digitised by Orkney Library and Archive. More recently, work has been done to add additional images, with Dr Garvie’s notes of who and what she photographed and additional details gathered from Fiona’s research involving islanders.\nDr Garvie captured moments in island life, such as work to put a new roof on a bakery building (Image: Orkney Library and Archive)\nIt means people with island connections from around the world will be able to search the Dr Garvie collection and potentially find images of their own family members.\nMeanwhile, the research and new exhibition, Finding Dr Garvie, has ignited new interest in her work.\nFiona handed vintage cameras to islanders and encouraged them to document their own lives. The results included modern-day images that mirror those taken a century earlier: scenes of crofting, families, of the old tradition of punding where North Ronaldsay’s seaweed-eating sheep are rounded up and checked, showing that while there has been changes, some things have stayed the same.\nSchoolchildren, too, have learned about the remarkable island GP, creating an animated film about her life and dressing up to recreate her photographs.\nNow there are hopes that the research and exhibition might led to more of Dr Garvie’s photographs and perhaps even journals and diaries from before and after her time on North Ronaldsay coming to light.\n“Her family didn’t even know she was a photographer,” adds Fiona. “All they knew was she was a doctor, not even that she was an early woman doctor.\n“She was a remarkable woman – determined, in capital letters, she went against the grain, and was a highly skilled photographer.”\nFinding Dr Garvie is at Pier Arts Centre until April 26.",

(Image: James Chapelard)Court members are permitted to attend meetings in-person and online via Zoom.\nDr Abu-Sittah told The Herald: “The Israelis were bombing the vicinity of the airport and threatening to target the hospital.\n\"I was on a humanitarian mission as a war surgeon. This meant I was either in the ER or OR tending to the wounded.\"\nDr Abu-Sittah spoke at an online event with Queen Mary, University of London nine days later.\nMembers of the university’s SNP society said they were “disappointed” Dr Abu-Sittah was unable to attend the crunch talks.\nA statement read: “We would like to begin by recognising and commending Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah’s life-saving humanitarian work, including his recent efforts in Lebanon and Gaza. His dedication to humanitarian causes is admirable and deeply respected.\n“However, we are disappointed by his absence from recent court meetings, particularly given his availability for lectures at other universities and press interviews at the time. We acknowledge the challenges he is facing and hope he will be able to attend future court sessions to advocate for the commitments he was elected to deliver.”\nProminent human rights attorney Aamer Anwar has defended Dr Abu-Sittah.\nAnwar, who was rector of the university between 2017 and 2020, said: “Dr Abu-Sittah’s accomplishments are on the record, he’s a surgeon who has risked his life trying to save lives in Gaza where they are feeling the impact of weapons and armaments.\n“As a rector, there were many occasions where the university court would use the processes and the procedures in order to divert my vote at the end of the day, and they would get the results that they wanted.\nAamer Anwar defended Abu-Sittah (Image: BBC) “It's the University management that should be getting targeted for this. Get your funds out of it. They've got money they are earning from other things, they don't need to earn it from weapons.”\nDr Abu-Sittah recently spoke out in defence of Hannah Taylor, a Glasgow University student banned from campus after spray painting the James McCune Smith Learning Hub.\nDr Abu-Sittah said: “Hannah Taylor and another student sprayed Glasgow University with water-soluble paint to protest the University’s refusal to divest from the arms trade – where the institution holds £6.8 million worth of shares.\n\"This disproportionate and authoritarian response is in keeping with a concerted effort to crack down on student activism for Palestine on campuses around the globe.\n\"Glasgow University’s motto is ‘Via, Veritas, Vita’ (the way, the truth, the life). Now this liberal facade has fallen. Today, Glasgow’s students are punished, threatened and intimidated for exposing the truth of their institution’s role in facilitating imperialism’s crimes.\"",

      "content_en": "He also said that a back-up transformer failed meaning systems had to be closed down in accordance with safety procedures so that power supplies could be restructured from two remaining substations to restore electricity enough to power what is described as a “mid-sized city”.\nMeanwhile Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said there are currently no suggestion of foul play in the fire and that there would be lessons to learn from the incident.\nThe west London airport initially announced it would be closed until 11.59pm but later said repatriation flights for passengers diverted to other airports in Europe would resume Friday evening.\nSeveral airlines announced they would restart scheduled flights both to and from Heathrow, including British Airways, Air Canada and United Airlines.\nRestrictions on overnight flights have also been temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, the Department of Transport said.\nHeathrow is expected to run a full schedule on Saturday.\nAround 200,000 passengers have been affected by the closure of what is Europe’s busiest airport.\nMr Woldbye said: “I’d like to stress that this has been an incident of major severity. It’s not a small fire.\n“We have lost power equal to that of a mid-sized city and our backup systems have been working as they should but they are not sized to run the entire airport.”\nAsked if there is a weak point in Heathrow’s power system, he said: “You can say that but of course contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100% and this is one of them.\n“This has been a major incident. I mean, short of anybody getting hurt, this is as big as it gets for our airport and we are actually coming back quite fast I would say, when you consider the amount of systems that we have to shut down then bring back up and make sure that they’re safe.”\nREAD MORE\nAll Scotland flights cancelled as Heathrow airport closes for the day\nHeathrow to ‘begin some flights later today’ after outage caused by fire\nHe added: “This is unprecedented. It’s never happened before and that’s why I’m saying it has been a major incident.”\nMr Woldbye went on to say the airport expects to return to “100% operation” on Saturday.\nHe said: “We expect to be back in full operation, so 100% operation as a normal day.\n“(Passengers) should come to the airport as they normally would. There’s no reason to come earlier.”\nThe CEO said Heathrow will “look at anything we can learn from this” and encouraged the Prime Minister to ask him any questions he has.\nSpeaking to reporters in Swindon, Ms Alexander acknowledged the “immense distress and disruption” caused by the closure of the airport but said the incident was “totally out of Heathrow’s control”.\nShe said: “They have stood up their resilience plan swiftly, and they’ve collaborated closely with our emergency responders and the airline operators, they do have backup energy supplies, they have generators, diesel generators.\n“None of that failed on this occasion because that backup supply is designed to protect the critical key systems within the airport and not to provide power to the whole airport.”\nThe Transport Secretary said she was in close contact with the Energy Secretary, the Home Secretary and with Heathrow to “make sure that any lessons we need to learn from the systems that the airport has in place are learned”.\nLondon Fire Brigade (LFB) received the first reports of the fire at 11.23pm on Thursday, forcing the closure of the airport.\nSome 120 aircraft heading to the airport at that time were forced to either divert or return to their point of origin, measures which saw passengers on board Qantas flights to Heathrow from Singapore and Perth diverted to Paris before taking buses to London.\nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police are leading the investigation into the cause of a fire.\nThe force said there was “no indication of foul play” but “we retain an open mind at this time”.\nThousands of homes were left without power and more than 100 people were evacuated after a transformer within the substation caught fire.\nHeathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9 million passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024.\nThis is believed to be the worst disruption at Heathrow since December 2010, when thousands of Christmas getaway passengers camped in the terminals because of widespread cancellations caused by snow.\nIn April of that year, air travel was grounded across Europe because of an ash cloud caused by an Icelandic volcanic eruption.\nOn Friday, Gatwick Airport accepted seven diverted flights from locations including Singapore, Johannesburg, Lagos, Cape Town and Doha which were originally destined for Heathrow.\nShannon Airport in Co Clare accepted six diversions from Toronto, Atlanta, Bridgetown Barbados, Boston, Orlando and Newark.\nAviation consultant John Strickland likened the disruption to what happened after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, when flights were grounded across the US, saying: “It’s a contained version of 9/11.”\nRory Boland, editor of magazine Which? Travel, said affected passengers are not entitled to compensation but airlines should provide assistance such as overnight accommodation if required and re-routing bookings, including with rival carriers from alternative airports.\nLFB deputy commissioner Jonathan Smith said: “The fire involved a transformer comprising of 25,000 litres of cooling oil fully alight.\n“This created a major hazard due to the still live high-voltage equipment and the nature of the oil-fuelled fire.”\nA local resident, who did not want to be named, said she heard a “massive explosion” before all the power went off, adding: “It just smelled like burning.”\nThere were no casualties at the scene of the fire, according to the London Ambulance Service.\nFootage posted to social media showed huge flames and large plumes of smoke coming from the facility.",

Our social security system is a collective endeavour designed to help the most vulnerable people in society. It’s not an individual endeavour.\n“And this is personal for me. My brother has advanced MS. He was an engineer to trade before he had to give that up. Then he worked in a call centre until his condition forced him to give that up too. To say that people like him are somehow skivers or malingerers playing the system is obscene.\n“There are many more like him. I live in a working class community in which everyone can point to the skivers and those who abuse the system but they are in a tiny minority. To lump those who have the misfortune to be disabled together with them is immoral.”\nWe discuss benefit fraud and mass immigration, these being the favoured iniquities of the right when they want to cut public expenditure.\n“Benefit fraud is minuscule compared with corporate tax fraud,” he says. “Yet there’s never been any attempt to go after them. The rewards of going after these characters and forcing them to pay their debts would be far greater than £5bn.”\nHe could also have mentioned The Post office scandal, Carillion, the Waspi women; the Hillsborough disaster, the Grenfell fire victims and their families. They all have one thing in common: they all represent injustices visited on working class people and their communities.\nThere’s another thread binding them: there is no committed desire to bring the perpetrators to justice, beyond official inquiries which deliver their verdicts long after another social injustice has taken their place. 'Let’s not be too hasty,' the political classes say to each other, 'they’ll soon have other things to worry about.'\nNeil Findlay believes Labour are running scared of Reform UK (Image: free) Neil Findlay’s disgust at those Labour MPs who were elected a year ago has turned to outright contempt. “With one honourable exception, Brian Leishman, none of them uttered a word,” he says. “None of the rest of them had the moral backbone to resist. How can they face their constituents after this? Were they really elected to help make their constituents poorer?\n“I’d like to see my own MP, Gregor Poynton, come to my local Miners' Welfare club to explain himself. In fact there’s an open invitation to him. I wrote to him a few times, but being a Labour MP these days seems to mean you no longer have to reply to your constituents.”\nMr Poynton was one of five Scottish Labour MPs who signed a letter backing the changes to the benefits system. A couple of them, like Blair McDougall and Frank McNally are, to my mind, careerists and you’d expect to see their names on something like this. But Joani Reid, grand-daughter of the great workers’ advocate, Jimmy Reid?\n“They’re delusional if they think this is what they must do to fend off the challenge of Reform UK. A far better way to fight Reform is to address the discontent in working class communities arising from the lack of housing; the lack of secure, decently-paid jobs and the crisis in our public services.\n“People across the north of England are fighting their neighbours to get their child into a decent school and there’s competition for the basics, such as an NHS appointment or a dental appointment. When someone else beats you, all too often people are encouraged to lash out at someone who’s not like them; who speaks a different language or has a different skin colour rather than see that it’s the consequence of a broken and badly managed system.”\nIt follows an old and depressing pattern. Avert the gaze of the public from your political ineptitude by demonising a community without the means to defend itself. And rely on the billionaire owners of the press and social media platforms and the state-funded BBC to assist.\nAnd so, there’s rarely any analysis of how the most deprived communities in the UK now were also deprived long before there were was a so-called problem with immigration. “These places are not deprived of spirt and decency and dignity and the ability to spot chancers,” says Mr Findlay. Unlike his once beloved Labour Party, I suggest.\n“Starmer defrauded the Labour membership by presenting a programme to get himself elected and then he systematically ripped up, as he’d always intended. I think he’s a consistent and compulsive liar. He’s reneged on almost every one of them.”\nAn unpleasant by-product of Labour’s betrayal of its founding principles has been the crowing of the SNP, a party which has never had any moral principles to betray beyond its purported dream of independence. And they’ve quietly ditched that one.\n“The SNP are atrocious at governing too,” says Neil Findlay. “Every public service in Scotland is worse than when they first came to power. They have never stood for anything beyond the career advancement of their leaders.\"\nSome of the trade unions have tried to resist Starmer’s anti-working class agenda. “Eleven general-secretaries wrote to him about the welfare reforms, but they’ve all been marginalised within the party. Starmer would ditch them entirely if he could. He’s much more wedded to the corporate world. Under him, Labour have taken extraordinary sums from Big Business. Wes Streeting has taken more than 100k from business donations alone, much of it from the private healthcare sector.”\nDoes he spare a thought for Labour’s Scottish leader, Anas Sarwar who’s vision of Holyrood power is receding amidst UK Labour’s national betrayal? “Not a bit of it,” he says of the man who helped orchestrate a campaign to discredit and undermine the Scottish Labour left. “Sarwar agrees with every aspect of Starmer’s programme.”\nRead more\n“His vainglorious words from six months ago must now be turning to ashes in his mouth. Then he’d spoken about inheriting a party who were at a low ebb and turning it around. His strategy, if that’s what you want to call it, was simply to win power at Holyrood on the coattails of Starmer’s UK victory and do nothing much beyond that.\n“There’s now every chance Labour could come third in Scotland. If that happens then he’ll no longer be considered the golden boy, but become the fall guy responsible for leading the party to its worst defeat in the devolution era. And besides, the same process of betrayal is happening in Scotland with Jackie Baillie being tasked with ensuring that candidates who don’t fit their personal politics are blocked, as we’re currently seeing in Edinburgh.”\nHe sees no prospect of redemption for Labour, only a steady darkening in its long-term future. “After two or three years of this, many of his MPs will realise they’re in danger of being turfed out after one term. That’s when they might move against him. They’ll absolutely have to in order to hang on to their seats.\n“And if Wes Streeting or Rachel Reeves came next, the situation would become worse.”",

      "content_en": "Wetherspoon, which has nearly 800 pubs across the UK, warned the forthcoming tax and labour cost hikes will increase costs by around £60m per year, equating to around £1,500 per pub per week.\nAnd while trading at Wetherspoon has been strong at the start of the second half – like-for-like sales increased by 5% in the seven weeks to March 16 – investors underlined their concern over the outlook for the industry, sending shares down nearly 8% today.\nCharlie Huggins, manager of the Quality Shares Portfolio at investment specialist Wealth Club, said the firm’s forthcoming rise in labour costs is “frankly crippling and will likely eat further into profit margins going forwards”.\nRead more:\n“The cost of a burger and pint will have to rise to help mitigate this pressure, which hardly encourages more punters through the door,” he added.\n“In all, aside from the depths of the pandemic, life has probably never been tougher for pub and bar operators. Wetherspoons has scale advantages others lack and a mightily loyal customer base, which really helps. But it is not immune to industry pressures.\"\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that if “pub takings are to be taken as another barometer of consumer health, investors can take some comfort that JD Wetherspoon’s like for like sales growth has accelerated slightly so far in the second half”.\nHowever, he cautioned that the 4.3% fall in operating profit to £64.8m reported for the first half “shows just how much of a challenge rising labour costs are for the group”.\n“And with national insurance and minimum wage increases around the corner the industry is bracing for another hit to margins,” Mr Nathan added.\nAs is now, customary Wetherspoon chairman and founder Tim Martin took aim the UK Government for taxing pubs differently to supermarkets as he outlined the expected impact from the forthcoming rise in labour costs.\n“Since labour costs are around 35% of the pub industry's sales, compared to around 11% for supermarkets, increases of this nature inevitably have a disproportionate impact on pubs, exacerbating the already-wide price differential for customers between the on and off-trade,” Mr Martin said.\n“The combination of much higher VAT rates for pubs than supermarkets, combined with increased labour costs will weigh heavily on the pub industry.\nMr Martin added: “The company currently anticipates a reasonable outcome for the financial year, subject to our future sales performance.”\nThe pub chief’s comments follow repeated warnings from the hospitality industry over the impact of the forthcoming increases in employer NICs and living wage.\nKate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, highlighted the vulnerability of firms in the sector as she responded to the surprise contraction of UK gross domestic product in January, which official figures confirmed last week.\n“The economy unexpectedly shrinking in January demonstrates how important action to kickstart the economy is,” she said. “Increasing costs across the board are putting intense pressure on both businesses and consumers, and this will only intensify in April, when £3.4 billion hits hospitality businesses.\n“Hospitality growth had been storming ahead in November and December but, like the economy, contracted in January. This shows how vulnerable businesses are and emphasises the need for action at the Spring Statement to reduce costs and boost business confidence.\n“With the right measures, namely delaying the lowering of the employer NICs threshold, hospitality has proven to be a sector that can react most strongly and deliver much-needed economic growth, alongside social value.”\nShares in JD Wetherspoon closed down 47.11p, or 7.89%, at 549.89p.",

      "content_en": "But then he adds, “It’s a lot of people really. That’s quite common.”\nYes, Peter Capaldi has made a record. Another one. After 2021’s Saint Christopher he returns this month with Sweet Illusions which has - as you now know - sweary bits (though, actually, not that many) and guitars and synthesisers and songs called things like The Big Guy and Bin Night.\nIt’s not really what you expect 66-year-old successful actors to do. Especially 66-year-old actors who are still busy with the day job. Right now Capaldi is shooting a second series of his Apple+ police series Criminal Record and you’ll see him soon in Black Mirror.\nRead more\nToday, though, he’s talking to me, and, yes, he’s talking a lot. About music and acting and ageing and anything else that comes to mind.\nWe start with the music. Even though he has previous as a musician - back at the start of the 1980s he was in a band with future comedian Craig Ferguson called The Dreamboys - it was still something of a surprise when he released his first album. Clearly, it didn’t scratch the itch and now he’s back with another.\nThe explanation is simple enough. “I enjoyed doing the first one so much I just wanted to carry on doing it,” Capaldi explains.\n“When I was a kid, if you wanted to record an album you had to be signed to a record label. I essentially do this myself. I have collaborators who I work with, but essentially if you have a computer and you’ve got GarageBand or Logic you can start to put songs together.\nPeter Capaldi as Malcolm Tucker in The Thick of It (Image: BBC)\n“I take it seriously but lightly, if you know what I mean,” he adds. “My intention is not to have a new career or be a pop star. It’s just a creative thing that is very accessible.”\nIt was his friend and producer Dr Robert - once of The Blow Monkeys - who first encouraged Capaldi to start writing songs. And now Capaldi can’t stop.\n“I read that the only way you get a good song is by writing a hundred terrible ones. I think I’m still working my way through the hundred.”\nThat’s self-deprecation at work. Sweet Illusions is far from rubbish. Ask him to describe what it sounds like and he says, “It’s fairly nostalgic guitar and synth tribute to eighties Glasgow. That’s what I think it is. Because I’m really picking up where I left off,” referring to his Dreamboys days 40 years ago.\nBut it’s also the work of a man in his mid-sixties. It’s unlikely that the twentysomething Peter Capaldi would be writing a song called Bin Night after all.\n“I’m a big fan of bin night. The night, not the song,” he quickly adds. “Because the world is chaotic, and terrible things are happening, and there’s only five minutes you get when you can exercise any control over your fate. And that’s bin night. If you get your bins together and you get them all out, you think, ‘Well, I’ve done something constructive.’”\nMore than that, though, Bin Night is also a love song to his grandchildren. “I became a grandfather. I wanted to do a lullaby because I have babies back in my life again.”\nThere is a lot of love on the album, it’s worth saying. If you have a tendency to conflate Capaldi with the parts he plays you might be surprised by quite how romantic it is. As he sings at one point, love is all that matters.\n“Yeah, it’s love that matters. That’s not a new line to have in a song, but you can do it in a song and it’s easier than doing it in a film or on stage. You can fill things with your own emotions.”\nIt’s possibly worth remembering at this point that Capaldi has been married to his wife Elaine Collins, herself an actor and now a TV producer, since 1991. They have been through the highs and lows of a life in acting together.\nPeter Capaldi as Doctor Who (Image: BBC)\nThat twentysomething singer in The Dreamboys, I say, does he feel very far away from you now, Peter?\n“Not very far. I mean, physically, yes. Because I’m an actor I get to see how I look and I’m always horrified to see this old guy with white hair. I don’t know where he came from. I don't imagine myself as that, but the parts I get are like that. I don’t feel that old.\n“The younger one is still there. The optimism is a bit more crushed. I went to the art school and at the time there was a great ethos of just having a go. It wasn’t just the art school. I guess that’s what the whole post-punk thing was, so I still carry that.\n“It doesn’t matter if what you do is great, what matters is you tried.”\nThe son of Nancy and Gerald John, who ran an ice cream business, Capaldi’s desire to be creative can be traced back to childhood in Glasgow.\n“I could always draw from when I was little. I remember my granny felt that drawing was an Italian thing. She was talking about Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, not the son of an ice cream van vendor.\n“But when I was little I remember I had a shoe box and - this is how long ago it was - I cut the front off of it and made a wee studio in it. It was Ready Steady Go, a programme that was the precursor to Top of the Pops, and I drew little people; little John, Paul, George and Ringo, and a camera and all that.”\nWhat he wanted back then, he says, was not to be an actor or a musician. It was simpler than that. “I wanted to be on the telly. I wanted to be part of that whole thing.”\nWhat eventually happened was that he met the film director Bill Forsyth who gave him a role in his film Local Hero.\n\"I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him and a lot of people wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for him,” he says of Forsyth. “My career is thanks to him.”\nLocal Hero: Christopher Rozycki, Jennifer Black, Fulton Mackay, Burt Lancaster, Peter Capaldi, Peter Riegert, and Denis Lawson (Image: Ronald Grant) Everyone asks you about Doctor Who and The Thick of It, I say, but what I really wanted to speak to you about was Ken Russell’s incredibly camp 1988 vampire movie Lair of the White Worm which also starred Hugh Grant and Amanda Donohoe. What was it like working with Russell, the master of excess?\n“It was great. We laughed so much. Hugh Grant was so funny. Such a smart, witty guy. He’s great company. Great cast all together, happy days.”\nAs for Russell himself, “he’d be fine in the morning and then at lunchtime he’d go into his trailer and he would emerge as the enfant terrible of the sixties. I don’t know if he had been quaffing champagne, or what had gone on at lunchtime, but he was mad then. He would push the cameraman off the camera and he would take over.\n“I remember he was very serious about that film. It subsequently became well known as a comedy, but that wasn’t intentional at the time.\n“It was a wee bit weird. I’d stumble onto a stage in Shepperton and there were some quite racy sequences that didn’t appear in the film being shot.”\nCapaldi had his own ambitions as a director. In 1992 he wrote and starred in the romcom Soft Top, Hard Shoulder alongside Collins and a year later he wrote and directed the short Franz Kafka’s It’s A Wonderful Life which won him an Oscar at the 1995 Academy Awards. At which point he was being courted by the Weinsteins and a career as a Hollywood hot shot seemed just a contract away, only for the Weinsteins to renege on the offer.\n“I think it was for the best,” he says now.\n“At the time it was difficult. The rug’s pulled from under your feet. But if I’d done that I wouldn’t have gone back to acting and I’ve enjoyed acting so much since then.”\nStill, a year to the day after winning an Oscar, he told Kirsty Young on her Radio 4 show Young Again in 2024, he was shooting a local dog food commercial.\nCapaldi looking as stylish as ever (Image: Paul Stuart)\n“We had to shoot it within the range of the M25, the ring road that goes around London, but the product was from Cornwall,” Capaldi recalls when I bring it up. “I had to find a farm and a field and a dog because we didn't have enough money to go any further than that\n“And the client, who was from Cornwall, said the soil was the wrong colour. ‘This is brown, the soil in Cornwall is red.’ What am I supposed to do with that information? So I thought I don’t want to spend my life doing this, apologising for the earth.”\nWhat followed were what we might call his Midsomer Murder years; guest parts in TV series and small parts in films.\n“I think I was a bit disappointed,” he says of that time. “You start to go, ‘Oh well, I’m not going to do those great parts or whatever. I’m just going to be a bellringer in Midsomer Murders.’ And there is a delight in that, a grace and a dignity in that. And I love that in actors. They really get knocked about. They’re up and down. They’ve got mortgages to pay and look after their kids. I can see it in their eyes.”\nOf course at that point he was also sharing a house with another actor.\n“That was where Elaine’s production career started because there was a period there where I really wasn’t earning anything. She made some enquiries with some friends who were working in production and she got a job reading scripts and doing reports for the BBC. And they were so impressed by her they said, ‘There’s a job going.’ A script assistant or something in the drama department. ‘Would you come in and try and go for it?’ “That’s how she eventually ended up becoming a producer.\nPeter Capaldi in Criminal Record (Image: Apple TV+)\n“She’s my boss just now,” Capaldi says, referring to Criminal Record. How is that?\n“She’s great. The show that we’re doing now I really enjoy doing. It’s very demanding,very modern, and the subjects that it deals with are hard.\n“And that all comes from her. Crime wasn’t a particular interest for her, but she’s extremely well read. People would come into the house and go, ‘Oh Peter, all these books, you must be very well read.’ I have to go, ‘They’re Elaine’s books. They’re not mine. My books are the Doctor Who annuals over there.’”\nHave you written a song for her yet, Peter?\n“Many songs. Many, many songs on the album.”\nIt was being cast as Malcolm Tucker in Armando Iannucci’s scabrous political sitcom The Thick of It that heralded the second act of Capaldi’s career. Those fey, gangly, awkward young men he played in his twenties were now pushed aside as he became the fire-breathing spin doctor with a caustic line in sweary putdowns.\n“That’s just what life does to you. I couldn’t have played that part until the time I played it,” he suggests. He needed to have experienced the “various kickings” life had in store for him, he says, to be able to play Tucker\n“I knew by the time I came to play that part that things could go wrong. I was tougher, I was a different person. That helped ignite Malcolm.”\nIt is now 13 years since he said goodbye to Tucker, eight years (and two Doctors) since he handed the keys of the Tardis to Jodie Whittaker. Capaldi has now moved into the veteran-stroke-legend part of his career. Or, as he would have it, his don’t-give-a-stuff years.\nThat’s what’s great about being in your sixties, he says, you don’t care anymore.\n“Physically, you can’t escape the fact that things can get a little bit tougher. But, as yet, that hasn’t really impacted me. I get a bit knackered, more knackered than I used to.”\nRead more\nHe pivots to the personal. “I love having grandkids. I love … I wouldn’t call it wisdom …There’s a kind of understanding, a perspective, about what’s important and what’s not important which you don’t have when you’re younger and I welcome that very much. You don’t waste your time. You’ve only got X amount.”\nHe smiles again. “It’s funny, my wife …” he begins, “I’ve never been obsessed with death or the ending of life. I think she’s been obsessed with it since she was a kid.\n“So, it’s only recently I’ve begun to realise, ‘Oh, right, so this doesn’t go on and on and on. There’s a point where this ends.’ And if you’re lucky it ends neatly.\n“So I am conscious of that, but it just makes me want to enjoy life more, be a part of life.\n“I’m very, very lucky because the shows that I’ve been involved in - obviously Doctor Who, but also The Thick of It - have a large appeal to young people. So I have a lot of young people talk to me. And also with the music, I’ve got a band who are all so much younger than me and it's great to be part of all that, to be in that world.\n“And it's very stimulating rather than just locking the doors and saying, ‘I'm going to be old now.’\n“Is it a struggle? I don't know. It’s a struggle sometimes because it's physically a bit tougher. But I don't find that I struggle psychologically. Other than the ticking clock.”\nTowards the end of last year Capaldi returned to playing music live with a gig in Stereo in Glasgow. He’s not sure if he’ll do many more.\n“I’m not trying to have another career, so I don’t really want to have a big tour. I don’t want a pile of people I have to answer to. So, we’re going to do Belladrum Festival in August and that’s great. The big band’s are on the big stage and we’re on a little stage and that’s perfect.\n\"And hopefully we’ll do a couple of gigs before that as well.”\nMaybe you could see the current chapter in Peter Capaldi’s life as a sort of homecoming. He’s reconnecting with that young musician he once was. And he is also reconnecting with his own origin story in Glasgow.\n“I’m in Glasgow much more now than I have been for years. My daughter, who was born and raised in north London, has moved to Glasgow with my grandchildren. Because although she was a north London girl her granny was in Glasgow and she’d come to Glasgow to see her granny who’s no longer with us. So she’s very familiar with the place. She loves Glasgow, she loves the scale of it, the kids love it, so we’re spending a lot more time there.”\nThere’s a sense of circularity in that, he admits, and a reminder of the city that made him who he is.\n“I love Glasgow. The thing is you carry it with you anyway. Glasgow is part of me and I’m happy about that.”\nPeter Capaldi talks a lot and, it turns out, he does know a thing or two. Whatever he might sing.\nSweet Illusions comes out on the Last Night From Glasgow label on Friday.\nCredits:\nWith thanks to the Lord Palmerston Pub, Dartmouth Road, London.\nBlue shirt and both suits by Edward Sexton, plum shirt by Paul Smith.\nPaul Stuart's Assistant: Elvis Elliott",

      "content_en": "Robert, 60, and his 24-year-old daughter Robyn, who the café is named after, have fond memories of the place in its heyday. Robyn started doing a Saturday job behind the counter when she was 12 and remembers vividly what it was like back then.\n“There was everybody from the offices and big orders from workmen and locals coming in,” she says. “It was mobbed. But now I can see the burden on my mum and dad.”\nStill Game being filmed in the café was also a happy time. Known as The Rendezvous Café on the show, it was used as a location for 16 years and to this day, there’s a Still Game breakfast menu featuring a “Jack and Victor” (full Scottish with tea and toast) and the “Isa Roll”, the same one she eats on the programme. Star of the show Ford Kiernan also has happy memories; filming in the café, he said, were “great times”.\nREAD MORE:\nMark Smith: A common sense solution at a Glasgow graveyard. Now let’s do the rest\nMark Smith: Move to the centre of Glasgow? Is that really a good idea?\nMark Smith: Here we go again. Why are so many Scottish laws a bit rubbish?\nBut sitting in the café now with a cup of tea, Robert – who had a long career as a chef before opening the café and was head chef at One Devonshire Gardens and The Waverley – says it’s become increasingly hard to make it work. “We’re losing between about £1,500 and £2,000 a month,” he says. “We’ve done it for about a year but we can’t do it anymore.”\nOne of the big problems is rising costs. “Before the Ukraine war and the energy crisis, our average bill for electricity was about £425 a month; it shot up to nearly £1,100. The oil went from £18 a drum to £40 a drum, eggs went from £10 a tray to £30 a tray. The running operation of the café was probably £22,000 a year for rent, rates, gas and electricity, it’s now working out at £41,000 a year.”\nThen there’s the drastic changes to the local area. “Passing trade is the most important factor for any business like ours,” says Robert, “And this was a busy area.\n“But I can tell you about everything that was here that isn’t anymore. The housing association offices, and other offices. The burgh halls were also being built and there were workers. Round the corner was a steel work place, the signing-on centre, the job centre. Then further on up a plastics works, we lost them. And the post office round the corner, the rumour is it’s closing. We’ve lost about 500 workers in the area over the last 6-7 years.”\nSome of the reasons for the changes are not unique to Maryhill – the pandemic, working from home, the move to doing business online – but Robert and Robyn say Glasgow City Council could have helped Robyn’s Nest but instead have made things worse. Robyn cites the business rates but there’s also the problem of Maryhill Road outside.\nRobyn Somerville with Isa from Still Game outside the cafe (Image: Newsquest)\n“The most important thing was they turned outside from a yellow line to a double line,” says Robert. “It means people can’t stop outside the café like they used to and it makes other aspects of the business harder too. We tried deliveries but they couldn’t stop outside. Glasgow City Council are putting so many obstacles in front of businesses.”\nThe other sad reality is that, even with a menu that’s amazing value for money, the cost of living has had an impact on customers. Robyn, who’s a civil servant, grew up in Maryhill and has worked with people on borderline budgets. There are 30 food banks in the area, she says, and even a price rise of 5 or 10p makes a massive difference.\nIt's something that bothers Robert too. He’s always supported local charities alongside running Robyn’s Nest and his other businesses, and he and wife Anne have just opened a discount store down the road. He does it because he sees how a lot of local people struggle.\n“Some people in the area who don’t want to see the café close down can’t afford to eat in it,” says Robert. “See that fiver that they used to have for their brekkie? It’s not there anymore. That fiver’s for nappies, or gas or electricity.”\nRobert’s love for the local area, and the people who continue to come to the café, is one of the reasons it’s taken a while to make the decision to close down, but he’s ready for it now. I ask what he thinks the fate of the café building will be?\n“Hospitality is getting the raw end of things of things just now,” he says, “But it might work as a Chinese takeaway or a kebab shop because that works 24/7 whereas a café is 10-3. But the heart’s been taken out of this area.\"\nRobert and Robyn will have their warm memories of the café though, when it was bustling and busy and when the Still Game crew were in filming. Robyn shows me a picture of her with Jane McCarry as Isa. Happy times.\nFord Kiernan also told The Herald about his happy memories of Robyn’s Nest. “It’s really sad to hear of the demise of the café,” he said. “We had great times filming in there, particularly the Kill Wullie episode. And it was especially terrific because we were working and filming in a real-life café that served up lovely grub.”",

      "content_en": "Holyrood is becoming a “hostile environment for women” and a significant number of female MSPs in the Scottish National party are stepping down before the May 2026 elections, citing lack of support from the party, tolerance of bullying, and abuse in the chamber and online.\nAlmost four years on from the election of a record number of 58 female MSPs across all parties in 2021, 14 SNP women have so far said they will not stand again, accounting for 23% of the party’s current MSP group.\nWhile some departures were expected, such as the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon and the 80-year-old veteran Christine Grahame, other exits raise questions about why women with seemingly burgeoning careers are choosing to step away.\nMichelle Thomson, who is standing down as MSP for Falkirk East, having previously served at Westminster, told the Guardian: “Politics is generally very misogynist, and I don’t think the SNP can be complacent about its own internal mechanisms which mean that examples of inappropriate male behaviour – including bullying and sexual harassment – are not tackled.”\nElena Whitham, an SNP former minister and another MSP not seeking re-election, said: “It’s not just about barriers to entry but to staying in politics. Neither party nor parliament are able to effectively support women when they encounter difficulties, and that’s why we are losing far too many talented women to the detriment of democracy.”\nThese concerns were shared by other SNP women who told the Guardian there was a chronic lack of support from the party, including for those with younger families. Some mentioned factional tensions and bullying within the party involving other female MSPs.\nNatalie Don-Innes is standing down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, citing “the sacrifices that being an elected member and a mother brings”.\nBut other women raised concerns about the Holyrood environment itself.\n“The bullying, booing and braying from the Tory benches whenever an SNP woman makes a progressive intervention is awful. Women feel they can’t speak up, especially on issues like LGBT+ inclusion,” said one former party official who regularly visited the parliament.\nOthers worry that the atmosphere will get worse if Reform UK wins upwards of 10 Holyrood seats, as polling predicts, and if former SNP MPs ousted in the party’s catastrophic general election defeat last July bring a more combative Westminster culture to the Scottish parliament.\nSome fear this is already happening, after reports that allies of the SNP’s leader in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, have a “hitlist” of sitting MSPs – all women – whom they hope to replace with former MPs in May next year.\nFlynn faced a fierce backlash last autumn when he announced that he planned to stand for Holyrood – potentially pushing out the incumbent female MSP – while maintaining his Westminster seat.\nHolyrood sources said that in addition to what could be bruising contests to select candidates, there were concerns the SNP would face a very difficult election because of its funding difficulties and a substantial drop in membership after the police investigation into its finances.\nIt is understood that has also weighed on some MSPs’ thinking.\nThis is all happening against a background of increasing online abuse, with a recent Holyrood magazine survey finding that female MSPs of all parties faced rape threats, death threats and severe misogynistic abuse.\nAlthough the SNP’s leader, John Swinney, has maintained Sturgeon’s tradition of a gender-balanced cabinet, some women described themselves as “furious” and “appalled” that equal representation reforms brought in by Sturgeon, including ensuring all-women lists where MSPs stood down, had been ditched for the next election.\nThe SNP said its legal advice was that because it achieved a 50/50 gender balance in 2021, it could not put in place similar corrective mechanisms this time.\nThe approved candidates list, circulated to SNP members last week, included 64 women (42%) out of a total of 152.\nThomson said there was “a very real risk that the SNP could take a significant step back in 2026”, pointing too to the lack of diversity among the approved men on the list.\n“The SNP put in all-women shortlists without looking at the systemic misogyny within the party,” said one prominent backbencher, “and it just elected women to a tough position with very little support. Holyrood is becoming a hostile environment for women.”",

      "content_en": "Star/Steer is a masterpiece from 1968 by the Scottish artist Ian Hamilton Finlay (1925-2006). What you see can be simply described. The word “star” appears a dozen times, screenprinted in silver on deep grey. They graduate down the page in a swaying column. Right at the bottom is a 13th word, “steer”, as if tethering – or guided by – all these descending stars.\nEach star is like an instance of itself, glimmering out of a fog, and the winding pattern irresistibly evokes starlight on rippling water. You look up to the stars, and down to the invisible boat summoned by that noun-verb “steer”. Which star to follow, how to navigate at sea, what the night skies can hold: the work is a visualisation, a poem and a prayer.\nView image in fullscreen Star/Steer, 1968 by Ian Hamilton Finlay: ‘a poem and a prayer’. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\nFinlay achieves all these sublime effects purely through the subtle arrangement of two words against two colours. His is an art of distillation, juxtaposition, thrift and contemplation. A poet before he became a concrete poet, a sculptor who became an “avant gardener”, as he put it, of that fabled landscape known as Little Sparta in the Pentland Hills beyond Edinburgh, Finlay understood as few other artists the emotional power of letters cutting into form, shape and colour.\nYou sense it over and again in this wonderful centenary commemoration at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. It’s there in the blue and white screenprint Evening Sail, which consists of the words “Evening Will Come They Will Sew the Blue Sail” running in classical script down a long deep blue banner, as if to suggest both the sail and the mariners’ shrouds sewn in antiquity from such sails at the end of the day. It’s there in the scarlet invectives, so exquisitely lettered on his behalf by Nicholas Sloan, against the government quangos Finlay despised: Pereant Tyranni Nummari (Let Perish the Money Tyrants).\nView image in fullscreen ‘Scarlet invectives’: Posters against the SAC: Pereant Tyranni Nummari (with Nicholas Sloan). Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\nAnd it runs through this show, as through his Pentlands garden, incised in all kinds of stone. A tank is delicately inserted into the pastoral relief Et in Arcadia Ego, embodying Virgil’s ringing memento mori, carved in the marble below. A bird table for Finlay’s garden doubles as a miniature aircraft carrier (imagine the birds landing and taking off), the letter E incised into its deck, a reference to the USS Enterprise, the longest nuclear-powered carrier in the world.\nOne gallery is filled with haunting photographs of Finlay’s artists’ signatures at Little Sparta, including his tribute to Albrecht Dürer. Above a stand of tall grass resembling Dürer’s own Great Piece of Turf, hangs his famous AD monogram incised in stone – as if Dürer had himself signed nature.\nHis art scarcely seems to comply with an embattled personality at constant war with institutions\nFinlay selects the mot juste with a poet’s precision. Take a work such as Wave Rock from 1966. The word “wave” runs back and forth, horizontally, up against a vertical heap of the word “rock”. The waves meet, depart, always unpredictable in their encounter with the rocks. Look closer, and the words “wreak” and “wreck” become discernible in the collision of letters. And all these words are etched on a sheet of sandblasted glass propped up in a bit of driftwood, like a letter in a rack. Everything flows, and connects.\nFinlay’s art is so refined, philosophical, antic in its wit and elegance, that it scarcely seems to comply with an embattled personality at constant war with institutions, galleries and publishers. But his long-running conflicts were notorious. A vivid gallery of films and photographs recounts his 1980s campaign against Strathclyde council for trying to force him to pay business rates on an old byre that he had converted into a classical temple. Local farmers joined in, blocking the marauding tax officials with their tractors. I especially like the poster Shock Tropes for Little Sparta (Sparta, of course, was at war with Athens).\nView image in fullscreen Wave Rock, 1966. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\n“Mors Concilio Artium” (Death to the Arts Council) is inscribed on blazing prints. When the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) accidentally returned some of Finlay’s stone carvings, his revenge was classical. The names of council functionaries, along with other enemies – including well-known painters and poets such as Elizabeth Blackadder and Iain Crichton Smith – are now carved in perpetuity on the back, along with a rousing tribute to Robespierre. Not incidentally, the SAC eventually gave them to the nation.\nThe French Revolution, battles on land and sea, historical warfare – all have enduring significance in Finlay’s art. He joined up in the second world war and his own position is always ambiguous. Two curious stone boots, exquisitely carved by John Andrew, are in fact representations of the funnels of the Mikuma, a Japanese cruiser deployed during the war. Terrifying on a vast scale, they are reduced to what Finlay ironically called paperweights. But lest we forget, the Mikuma was sunk in 1942 by the US with most of its crew.\nView image in fullscreen Et in Arcadia Ego, 1976 by Finlay, with John Andrew. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay © the estate of John Andrew\nIt feels apt that such a show should take place in the neoclassical grandeur of the former Dean Orphanage in Edinburgh. One of the most immaculate works here – poised between antiquity and conceptualism – is the tiny Marble Paper Boat, in which an origami vessel crests the fluted waves of a stone finial that would not look out of place in the Georgian architecture of the city’s New Town.\nIf only this exhibition stretched from the ground floor to the upper galleries too. But Finlay is widely spread in his centenary year, with several other shows, including one at Victoria Miro, London (30 April-24 May), and an illustrated book of essays by writers including the late, lamented Tom Lubbock.\nWhat makes this particular exhibition so special, moreover, is its emphasis on the intimate: many small sculptures raised up to perfect viewing levels on plinths, the walls dense with exquisite screenprints. What you see is Finlay’s mind in closeup – words and ideas forming into two- and three-dimensional works of unique and visionary art.",

[As] I have said to all of you many times, I have done nothing wrong, so I was confident of reaching this point but obviously it is a relief now to have that confirmed,” she said.\n“For almost two years I have had this cloud of investigation hanging over me. It won’t surprise anybody to hear me say that’s not been an easy experience, so to reach this point today is obviously something I am relieved about. I’ve been trying to go on with my life and I now intend to do that.”\nBeattie told reporters at Holyrood on Thursday he was very relieved to have been cleared, and said he intended to stand again for parliament next year.\n“I knew myself I had done nothing wrong but two years is a long time to wait for a result,” he said. “I’ve had tremendous support from constituents and members. I can at least relax and get back to family life now.”\nThe confirmation came after it emerged that Murrell, who served as the SNP’s chief executive for 22 years, had made no plea during his court appearance, a routine hearing that formally begins the prosecution process.\nThe Crown Office has not yet released the charge against him.\nMurrell was arrested in April 2023 after police came to the home he then shared with Sturgeon in Uddingston, as police mounted a simultaneous raid on the SNP’s headquarters near the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.\nPolice erected tents outside their detached home, carrying out extensive searches of the property and its garden and shed, while removing documents and computers from their home and the SNP’s offices.\nPolice later confiscated a luxury motorhome parked outside Murrell’s mother’s home in Fife.\nAfter being released pending further investigation, Murrell was rearrested on 18 April 2024 and charged with embezzlement. In late 2024, Police Scotland submitted an extensive report to the Crown Office, setting out the evidence it had gathered.\nMurrell has made no public comment about his arrest or the investigation, but Sturgeon has repeatedly said she was innocent of any wrongdoing since her arrest in June 2023.\nSturgeon, whose memoirs will be published in August, announced in January that she and Murrell were to divorce and indicated they had been living separate lives for some time. Earlier in March, she confirmed she would not be standing for re-election to Holyrood in next year’s Scottish parliament elections.",

You can’t help but want to go out on your bike.”\nThe Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, described the spectacle of the race as “the only sports event made for people who don’t like sport” and recalled seeing riders applauding spectators in Yorkshire in 2014. “That’s very rare,” he said.\nThere will be six Tour stages in total in the UK in 2027, three stages of the men’s Tour and three of the women’s race. “I think it’s brilliant,” Cavendish said. “Cycling’s been at the forefront of pushing equality.”\nThe conversations between Edinburgh and Paris stretch back almost 20 years, but the project became more ambitious once the Tour de France Femmes was relaunched three years ago.\nView image in fullscreen Charlotte Kool celebrates victory in the first stage of the Tour de France Femmes, from Rotterdam to the Hague, in 2024. Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/Shutterstock\n“We set out to host the Tour de France and Tour de France Femmes because we believe that live sport is a fundamental part of our country’s social fabric,” Simon Morton, director of events at UK Sport, said.\n“This will be the biggest free spectator event ever hosted in the UK, offering the public front-row access to world-class sport across villages, towns and cities.”\nThe details of the men’s race are to be confirmed but Edinburgh, Glasgow, the Lake District, Manchester, mid-Wales and south Wales are all expected to feature.\nAfter a stage finish in Cardiff, the race convoy is likely to transfer from south Wales to continue the Tour on French soil.\nIn 2014 more than 3 million spectators were estimated to have watched the men’s race as it headed to London from Leeds. That number will surely be eclipsed in 2027.\nThe 2027 Tour de France Femmes is believed to be starting in Leeds. The Tour owners, ASO, remained coy about the details of the women’s race, although Prudhomme said the women’s race may fall a little later than usual to accommodate event logistics.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You see the impact it has everywhere the Tour goes. You saw it in Yorkshire, a few years back, so it will be really special. It will give such a boost to cycling in Scotland and it gives me a lot of motivation to be there, to be part of that.”\nPete Ellen, who runs the Cycling Academy for elite young Scottish road cyclists and who rides with the Edinburgh Road Club, one of the country’s largest, said the arrival of the Tour was “brilliant” for cycling in Scotland.\n“It’s incredibly well run, and they’re really good at getting community involvement,” he said. “It will get more people on their bicycles, riding around and having fun. The more people who are riding their bikes the better the world will be. It’s as simple as that.”\nThe Aberaeron-born Josh Tarling, who is racing with Ineos Grenadiers, said the news that the 2027 Tour would visit Wales was “a proud moment”.\nThe intention to bid for the Tour, as part of a £30m package for major events first announced in Rishi Sunak’s autumn budget in 2021, originally targeted a Grand Départ in 2026, but next year’s Tour will start in Barcelona.\nFurther details of all the stages are expected to be announced in the autumn.",

The government must drop this cruel proposal or it’ll face the mother of all rebellions. Burgon was referring to what happened when the SDLP MP Colum Eastwood asked Starmer to justify the new Pip rules. (See 12.54pm.) Eastwood said: A lady came to see me recently who needed help. She had a disability. It meant that her children had to help her cut up her food. They have to help her wash beneath her waist. They have to supervise her as she goes to the toilet. Under the Tory welfare system we were able to get that lady on Pip. Under the prime minister’s new proposed system, she will get zero, nothing. And after 14 years of the Tory government – and many of us wanted to see the back of them – can the prime minister answer one question – what was the point if Labour are going to do this? In response, Starmer said that lived with the impact of disability through his mother (who had Still’s disease and was in a wheelchair for much of his life) and through his brother (who had learning difficulties), but that he thought the current welfare system was “indefensible”. He did not say why Eastwood’s constituent should lose her Pip, but he said under the government’s plans “if you can never work, you must be supported and protected”. On Newsnight last night the SNP MP Kirsty Blackman made a similar point about how the new Pip rules will work. She said: If you, for example, can’t put on your own trousers, if you cannot get in and out of the shower yourself, if you are not able to go to the toilet without supervision, you still may not make the criteria [to keep getting Pip], because none of those things get you four points. Blackman was referring to the change in the eligibility rules set out in the green paper yesterday. It says: We will introduce a new eligibility requirement to ensure that only those who score a minimum of 4 points in at least one daily living activity will be eligible for the daily living component of Pip. This requirement will need to be met in addition to the existing Pip eligibility criteria. This means that people who have lower needs only in the daily living activities (scoring 3 or less for each activity) will no longer be eligible for the daily living component of Pip. Meanwhile, people with a higher level of functional need in at least one activity – for example, people who are unable to complete activities at all, or who require more help from others to complete them – will still receive Pip. Pip works on a points system, where points are awarded by level of disability in relation to various activities. There is a guide to the points here. Share\n4d ago 13.15 EDT Hancock dismisses criticism of 'VIP lane' for PPE procurement during Covid crisis as 'wholly naive' Matt Hancock has described criticism of the so-called “VIP lane” that meant some PPE contract offers were prioritisied for Whitehall consideration during Covid as “wholly naive”. Giving evidence to the Covid inquiry in a hearing held as part of its PPE module, the former health secretary was asked about evidence submitted by an expert describing the “VIP lane” process as “problematic”, in part because there was “no consideration given to the risk of de facto differential treatment”. At a time when the government was desperate to acquire PPE, and inundated with offers from contractors largely unknown to Whitehall, the “VIP lane” enabled ministers to recommend offers from people who contacted them directly for priority consideration. The government defended the scheme on the grounds that final decisions were always taken by officials. But the initiative continues to be mired in controversy, not least because it was used by the Tory peer Michelle Mone to obtain contracts that are now subject to an ongoing criminal investigation. Asked about the expert’s comment criticising the scheme, Hancock replied: What I would say about that particular paragraph that you read out is that it is wholly naive as to the circumstances that we face. The point about naivety is really, really important. It’s fine having academics write papers about this stuff, and some of the academic analysis of how you could do better in a future pandemic is really, really valuable. But it can only have any value at all if you understand what it was like. You know, you weren’t there. This professor wasn’t there. But you’ve got to understand what it was like. The pressure to save lives is intense, but so is the reality that high-quality offers will come through and be sent through to senior decision makers, and you have to have a process for dealing with that. Apologising for being “impassioned” in his evidence, Hancock went on: I have been subject to enormous amounts of conspiracy theories about what went on here when, in fact, what happened was so many people working as hard as they could to save lives, and they bought more PPE as a result, and therefore people are alive who would otherwise be dead. And frankly, I’m incredibly proud of the people who themselves have felt under attack because of the way that questions have been put, which does have a material consequence on future responses to a pandemic. Hancock also said it was important to ensure that, in future, “more bureaucracy” did not get in the way of effective procurement in an equivalent crisis.

As PA Media reports, speaking to reporters in Grangemouth, the first minister said Keir Starmer’s government wanted to enact cuts that would punish “the most vulnerable in our society”. During the general election campaign last year, Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, had told voters: “Read my lips: no austerity under Labour.” The SNP claims the benefit cuts announced yesterday, among other measures, amount to austerity – something that has been rejected by Sarwar but echoed by a senior member of his team at Holyrood, PA says. Carol Mochan, Scottish Labour’s public health spokeswoman, contradicted her boss in a social media post on the welfare cuts by saying: Austerity has never been a sustainable path to growth. We cannot balance the books on the backs of people who require benefits just to have a passable standard of living. These reforms are a mistake and should not go ahead. Swinney said he “could not fathom what the Labour Government thinks it is doing”. He added: I think it’s made a number of huge mistakes already. The winter fuel cut was a disastrous mistake for the Labour government to make. That proposal was offered to the Tories on countless occasions and they never took it. The Labour Party has taken that cut and they’ve now taken cuts to disability benefits, which even the Tories didn’t do. Swinney also said he was “not surprised” the cuts led to Neil Findlay quitting the party. (See 11.13am.) And he claimed Sarwar had broken his pre-election pledge. We now know that Anas Sarwar’s words count for absolutely nothing. This is the return to austerity that I told everybody would happen unless some of the hard realities of the public finances were addressed. Labour are interested now in returning austerity and punishing the most vulnerable in our society. What disgrace the Labour party has become.

Photograph: Michael Boyd/PA Share Updated at 13.48 EDT\n4d ago 12.27 EDT In a Guardian column Frances Ryan says the plans for cuts to sickness and disability benefits announced yesterday are “rotten with contradictions and cruelty”. Here is an extract. Even with the U-turn, the bulk of the cuts will fall on the Pip budget, despite the benefit having nothing to do with employment. Indeed, removing Pip – which is often used to pay for taxis, mobility aids and care staff – is more likely to push disabled people out of employment. Pip is also a “gateway benefit”, and ministers are yet to address whether those losing it could see their families lose vital carer’s allowance too. Meanwhile, the plan to reduce UC for the whole “unfit to work category” will hit many severely ill and disabled people who will not be protected by the new premium. Ministers say this will “incentivise” people to stay in the work-search group, as if the reason a teacher confined to bed with ME quit her job is that she’s just not incentivised enough. This is austerity dressed up as reform, where the government cuts the money disabled people need to live on in order to balance the books, while claiming it’s all being done to help them.

The Liberal Democrats are proud we have led the fight to exempt health and care providers from this misguided tax hike, and we will not give up now.

The government won by 307 votes to 182 – a majority of 125. Defending the proposal to reject the amendment, James Murray, a Treasury minister, said that if the government did not get this income, other tax rises, cuts, or borrowing would be needed. He told MPs: We have had to take difficult but necessary decisions to repair the public finances and rebuild our public services … In order to restore fiscal responsibility and get public services back on their feet, we needed to raise revenue including through the measures that this Bill will introduce and many of the amendments from the other place put at risk the funding that this Bill seeks to raise. So let me be clear, to support these amendments is also to support higher borrowing, lower spending or other tax rises. But the Conservative MP Wendy Morton accused the government of “giving with one hand but taking away with the other”. She said: The hospice sector is just one example of many sectors which have been adversely affected by this cruel tax that the government is placing on them. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said the Lords had made 21 amendments to the government’s original bill. “Taken together they provide protections for health and care providers, for small charities with an annual revenue of less than £1 million, for transport providers for children with special educational needs and disabilities, for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees,” she said.

Share Updated at 09.58 EDT\n4d ago 09.53 EDT Starmer declines to repeat at PMQs Reeves' pledge not to extend income tax threshold freeze Here is the PA Media news story from PMQs. Keir Starmer failed to repeat the chancellor’s commitment not to extend the freeze on income tax, ahead of next week’s spring statement. Kemi Badenoch pressed the prime minister to reaffirm the pledge during PMQs. In the autumn budget, Rachel Reeves decided not to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax. Thresholds were initially frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028. In the Commons, the Conservative leader also accused Starmer of digging his own black hole and urged him to protect hospices from national insurance increases. Badenoch said: “The chancellor promised a once-in-a-parliament budget that she would not come back for more. And in that budget, she said there will be no extension of the freeze in income tax thresholds. Ahead of the emergency budget, will he repeat the commitment that she made?” Starmer replied: “She’s got such pre-scripted questions she can’t actually adapt them to the answers that I’m giving. I think she now calls herself a Conservative realist. Well, I’m realistic about the Conservatives. “The reality is they left open borders and she was the cheerleader. They crashed the economy, mortgages went through the roof. The NHS was left on its knees, and they hollowed out the armed forces. “This government has already delivered two million extra NHS appointments, 750 breakfast clubs, record returns of people who shouldn’t be here, and a fully-funded increase in our defence spending. That is the difference that a Labour government makes.” UPDATE: Reeves is not going to extend the income tax threshold freeze in the spring statement, the Guardian understands. See 1.57pm.

      "content_en": "There is a realistic chance that one of the UK’s largest oil refineries can be converted into a hub for green chemicals, sustainable fuels and plastics, Scotland’s first minister says.\nGrangemouth oil refinery, which is being shut down by its UK and Chinese owners PetroIneos this year with the loss of 400 jobs, could become a world leader in low carbon chemicals and green fuels, John Swinney told media on Wednesday.\nThe refinery’s closure, after 100 years of production, is expected to hit up to 2,000 jobs in the east of Scotland. Trade union leaders and policymakers see Grangemouth as a casestudy in ensuring the transition from oil and gas is fair and just.\nSwinney said workers and local businesses faced “enormous difficulties”.\n“What we have to make sure is that we manage the transition from the dependence on fossil fuels to an approach that delivers net zero,” he said. “I think it can be done at scale [and] I’m confident we can deliver those new prospects for these communities.”\nHe was speaking after the UK and Scottish governments published a report from the consultancy EY that said up to 1,200 jobs could be created by attracting low-carbon businesses to Grangemouth. However, that would be too late for workers being laid off this year.\nEY identified nine industries including plastics recycling; biorefining of chemicals from organic waste; bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel production; biomethane production from organic waste; and low-carbon hydrogen from renewable sources and ammonia.\nThose industries would require substantial investment, the report said. About £3.5bn would be needed to create about 800 jobs over the next decade. As much as £7.5bn could be spent if those businesses expanded, to create 1,200 jobs by 2040.\nEarlier in March Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced £200m in UK government funding to help support five green businesses at Grangemouth; the Scottish government has put up £25m for a just transition fund.\nMichael Shanks, the UK government’s energy minister, chaired a local taskforce meeting with Gillian Martin, the Scottish government’s net zero secretary, on Wednesday morning. “We are committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth,” he said.\nEnergy analysts and environment campaigners are sceptical about some of these technologies, in particular mass production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, because they believe the costs and energy involved greatly outweigh the gains.\nBut Mark Simmers, chief executive of Celtic Renewables, a Grangemouth-based firm where Swinney launched the report, which is already making green chemicals, said he believed the plans were realistic.\nHis firm, which makes acetone, butanol and ethanol by fermenting whisky byproducts, waste potatoes and molasses, hopes to build a plant eight to 10 times larger than its current factory at the refinery site. Its products help make nail varnish, paints, medicines and household cleaning products, replacing crude oil-based chemicals.\n“We’ve got this great facility with a range of utilities, land and a lot of resources from a feed stocks perspective, but also from a people perspective,” Simmers said. “So repurposing that for a low carbon manufacturing complex, I think is a great and a realisable plan.”\nThe investment agency Scottish Enterprise would oversee possible investments, Swinney said. “This is going to take time. It’s going to take investment, and it’s going to take commitment, but the Scottish government is here for the long haul,” he said.",

His mother had complained to the hospital of severe back pains but was told to take paracetamol; soon afterwards she gave birth in the bathroom at home.\nThree weeks later, Ellie McCormick died from oxygen starvation five hours after birth at a different hospital. Her mother told the ward by phone she was experiencing contractions; she was advised to take painkillers and call back if her waters broke or she was not coping.\nThree hours later she called, and was admitted to hospital for an emergency caesarean when staff found Ellie had a slow heart rate. The baby did not survive.\nIn the third case, in July 2021, Mira-Belle Bosch died 12 hours after birth owing to brain injuries from lack of oxygen during birth. Her mother had reported contractions and that her waters had broken three days earlier.\nShe said she was comfortable at home but two days later, her baby’s feet were presenting. Paramedics were unable to deliver the baby and it took them five attempts to reach the hospital maternity unit by phone. Mira-Belle was born in hospital but was unresponsive; her ventilator was switched off two days later.\nAnwar said: “The death of a child is an unimaginable and deeply painful event in an parent’s life, one from which it is undoubtedly difficult to recover.\n“The purpose of this inquiry is to understand what happened and what might be done in future to avoid such tragedy. I again offer my deepest condolences to the parents of Leo, Ellie and Mira-Belle.\n“Each gave evidence with great dignity and sought to assist the inquiry notwithstanding the anguish and heartache each has suffered.”\nIn a statement, the McCormick family said they could not have imagined the individual and system failures the inquiry brought to light.\n“What seemed to be flaws with the electronic system of record keeping actually turned out to be a catalogue of errors with numerous opportunities to avoid the tragic outcome that followed,” they said.\n“It was extremely difficult for the family to hear the evidence and reading the determination is bittersweet in terms of achieving some sense of closure but also learning once again how different things ought to have been.”",

Dore said: “I categorically did not tell Gina to keep her mouth shut.”\nDore told the court that Clarke had been “very protective” of Powell, treating her like “a little sister” because she was a woman working in the film industry, he knew one of her family and “wanted her to be treated with respect”.\nIt has emerged that at least five of the 15 people who were supposed to give oral evidence in support of Clarke’s claim will no longer be doing so.\nThey include the former EastEnders actor, Nabil Elouahabi, who was due to be cross-examined on Monday. The court heard he would no longer be appearing before it.\nSo far, nine witnesses have given oral evidence for Clarke, including Clarke himself. A summons to appear in court has been sent to a 10th witness Arnold Oceng, who appeared in Clarke’s films Brotherhood and Adulthood, but Millar said he was not living at his given address, nor had he responded to a WhatsApp message. The reasons for witnesses not appearing have not been disclosed in court.\nGNM’s witnesses, of whom there are 32 in total, will begin giving oral evidence on Tuesday. An application for GNM to add another witness, Anita (not her real name), was rejected by the judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, on Monday after Clarke’s legal team opposed it.\nMillar said Anita had come forward in response to media coverage of the trial.\nThe court heard that her proposed evidence included that Clarke put pressure on her to allow him to take an explicit photograph of her in a public place in Soho House, central London.\nSteyn said that while Anita’s evidence was “of some importance”, it was not critical given the other evidence available and could delay the trial.",

He said a ceasefire offer was now on the table, “Ukraine is serious about peace”, and it was now up to President Putin to decide how to respond. He said: Now it is Putin who stands in the spotlight, Putin who must answer, Putin who must choose. Are you serious, Mr Putin, about peace? Will you stop the fighting? Or will you drag your feet and play games, pay lip service to a ceasefire while still pummeling your prey? My warning to Mr. Putin is this – if you are serious, prove it with a full and unconditional ceasefire now. But Lammy said Putin did not seem interested in a ceasefire, and so the G7 was considering further action. If Putin does not deliver, and I must tell the house that I currently see no sign yet that he is, the G7 meeting helped us ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously. We’re not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a ceasefire, we have more cards that we can play. We can all see the impact the G7’s unprecedented sanctions have had on Russia’s faltering economy; social spending down, inflation and interest rates sky high. There can be no let up in our efforts. In Canada we discussed where we can go further to target their energy and defence sectors, further squeeze their oil revenues and use frozen Russian assets. At the same time we will keep up our support to Ukraine – Europeans clearly need to shoulder our share of this responsibility.

Experts criticise Streeting for saying mental health problems overdiagnosed Read more According to polling by YouGov, almost four out of 10 people (37%) seem agree with Streeting that getting a diagnosis is too easy. But 32% say getting a diagnosis is too hard, and 14% say the balance is about right – meaning at last 46% don’t agree with Streeting. (Streeting talked about there being “overdiagnosis” of mental health conditions, whereas YouGov asked about it being “too easy” to get a diagnosis; the terms have different connotations, although roughly they imply the same thing.)

Women are more likely to say getting a diagnosis is too hard, not too easy – while men are more likely to say the opposite. The under-50s are more likely to say getting a diagnosis is too hard, not too easy – while the over-50s are more likely to say the opposite. People from London and Scotland are more likely to say getting a diagnosis is too hard, not too easy – while people from the rest of Britain are more likely to say the opposite.

In another exchange Siân Berry, the Green MP, asked for an assurance that the benefit cuts being proposed would not be implemented this calender year, or without a vote by MPs. Stephen Timms, the social security and disability minister, replied: I recognise there has been a good deal of anxiety and I regret that that has occurred.

Share Updated at 12.39 EDT\n6d ago 12.22 EDT The urgent question is over, but Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, is now raising a point of order. Jenrick claims that Nicholas Dakin, the justice minister, misled MPs when he said the new Sentencing Council guidelines were approved by the last government. He says that the guidelines on which the last government was consulted were not the same as the ones finally published, because new wording was added, as the council itself admitted in its recent letter. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, objects, and tells Jenrick to accuse Dakin of inadvertently misleading the house. MPs are not allowed to accuse each other of being deliberately misleading, or lying. Dakin says he doesn’t think he inadvertenly misled MPs. Share\n6d ago 12.06 EDT Justice minister Nicholas Dakin says he's 'confident' that Sentencing Council will respond to government's concerns Desmond Swayne (Con) said the Sentencing Council row showed why it was a mistake for MPs “to delegate powers to quangos which then clearly come up with solutions which we find repulsive”. Dakin says, if Swayne had been present at the meeting last week, he would not have seen it as Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, just “asking” for a new approach. He says there was a constructive exchange of views and that a “proper process” is now in place, “which I am confident will come up with the right answer”. Share\n6d ago 12.01 EDT Josh Babarinde, the Lib Dem justice spokerperson, said two-tier justice already existed in the UK. He said the country used to be run by “two-tier Tories who thought they could get away with illegal number 10 parties, while the rest of us told to stay at home”. And he described Jenrick as a two-tier Tory “who unlawfully approved a development for his donor”. Share\n6d ago 11.56 EDT Andy Slaughter, the Labour chair of the Commons justice committee, spoke out in defence of the Sentencing Council. He said the new guidelines did not require pre-sentence reports to be obtained for offenders in the designated categories, including minority ethnic people, and did not prevent judges getting pre-sentence report for other people. Dakin said Slaughter was making a good point. Share\n6d ago 11.53 EDT Responding to Jenrick, Nicholas Dakin, the justice minister, said Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, met the Sentencing Council to discuss this dispute last week. He says they had a “constructive discussion” and Mahmood agreed to set out her objections in more detail in writing. The council agreed to consider those before the guidelines came into effect. Dakin said this process should be allowed to play out. Share\n6d ago 11.49 EDT Robert Jenrick uses urgent question to call for officials who drew up new Sentencing Council guidelines to be sacked Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, is now asking a Commons urgent question about the new Sentencing Council guidelines that he claims will create “two-tier justice”. He says the guidelines, which say judges should normally ask for pre-sentence reports when certain categories of offender, including minority ethnic offenders, are being sentenced. This violates the prinicple of equality before the law, he says. He says the people who draw up the guidelines should be sacked. He says the government should back his bill allowing the government to intervene.

      "content_en": "It’s late on a Saturday night in the tiny Scottish fishing village of Ullapool, well past 1am, and bass is pulsing out into the otherwise quiet streets from a quaking function room. This is Baile/Baile, possibly the most remote regular club night in the UK.\nLocated about 60 miles northwest of Inverness, and the same distance from the very top of mainland Scotland, Ullapool has long been an important hub for the surrounding villages. Despite only having a population of around 1,500, it has plenty of art studios, cafes, galleries and a museum. Plus, it’s home to a highly regarded school for traditional arts and Gaelic language. There’s an annual book festival and, from 2005 to 2019, there was a two-day music festival called Loopallu, headlined over the years by Mumford & Sons, Franz Ferdinand and Idlewild. The village is packed over summer thanks to the North Coast 500, a 516-mile scenic driving route around the northern peripheries of Scotland.\nUllapool has a history of dance culture, too. In the 1990s, a crew threw DIY raves in the area but, with funding cuts and an ageing population, Sigi Whittle, the co-founder of Baile/Baile who grew up locally, felt it was his turn to inject some life. “I was getting frustrated that things were tapering off,” he says. “There was a gap in the market and I wanted to give something back.”\nView image in fullscreen Panoramic views … a wholesome hike. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nLaunched in November 2023 by 28-year-old Whittle and his friend Jemima Fasakin, Baile means village in Gaelic and dance in Spanish. It brings established UK artists to the Highlands while giving much-needed opportunities to local DJs. During winter, Ullapool locks down, braced for the brutal weather, so Whittle and Fasakin (a Londoner living in Glasgow) decided to host their night from November to March. “The tourists leave,” Whittle says, “and the only people left are the people living in the village.”\nIt’s not just tourists who leave: the Highlands have a hard time retaining their youth. Cultural resources get funnelled to the cities, so young people like Whittle usually move out when they turn 18. He now lives in Edinburgh, where he works as a trainee architect, but his mum still lives in Ullapool. She often allows visiting DJs to sleep at her house.\nThe Baile/Baile venue, a family-run motel and function room called the Ceilidh Place, usually hosts traditional Gaelic music events, but tonight the 100-capacity space has transformed into a nightclub. Bouncer Alan Nutu, a local, is on security with hotel manager and sound engineer Gary Craig on lights and smoke machine. “We’ve had amazing DJs,” says the later. “People coming up from down south, wondering why they’ve never been here. It’s all been really positive.”\nKen McDonald (Dulcey to his friends) has dusted off the sound system he used for throwing raves in the 90s, while Whittle and Fasakin have hired decks from a club crew in Inverness. On the lineup are DADs, the Newcastle-based breaks and UK garage duo, plus Stevie Cox and Telford, house DJs and residents at Glasgow’s Sub Club.\nView image in fullscreen Sigi Whittle and Jemima Fasakin, co-founders of Baile/Baile. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nThis is the last event of the season and by 9.30pm the venue’s already filling up. Young men in bucket hats and sunglasses punch the air as Whittle (DJ Cablecar) and Fasakin (Jemima from the Bible) play their bass-heavy opening set. It’s a mixed crowd, with fresh-faced 18-year-olds dancing alongside folk in their 60s. About half are local, the other half having travelled from Glasgow, Edinburgh and London.\nBy 11pm, the venue’s at capacity and the energy is sky-high. The crowd’s locked in – there’s nowhere else to be tonight – and they dance unselfconsciously to DADs’ break-filled selection, a far cry from inner-city club standards. When Stevie Cox and Telford play their opening house track, a woman wearing LED-flashing trainers does a little dance routine next to the decks.\nJoseph Marsh has attended every Baile/Baile since its inception. “It’s brilliant for the community,” says the 24-year-old, whose parents used to attend Dulcey’s raves in the 90s. “I’ve grown up here and there’s been nothing. I just wish it happened more often.”\nThey’ve done such a good job, they’ve had to book an entire hostel to host people who travelled up for the weekend. On Friday night, about 50 revellers descend on Ullapool, packing out the nearby pub and emptying the chippy of haddock.\nView image in fullscreen Hardy souls … a dip at Ardmair. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nOn Saturday, ravers hike up Meall Mhor, or Ullapool Hill, for panoramic views, while a few brave souls even go swimming. “It’s nice,” says Fasakin, “to have wholesomeness built into the weekend.”\nSaturday night is Baile/Baile and by 2am Stevie Cox and Telford are wrapping up their set with a techno banger. The venue is still at capacity, the punters packed in like sardines, and Whittle holds up the strobe light while Craig goes nuts with the smoke machine. When the music fades out, the crowd bursts into applause. Alan the bouncer thanks everyone as they file past, wishing them a safe journey home as they disperse into the silent village streets.",

Your article draws on the ill-will whipped up by some, but overlooks the evidence and the legacy of designation decisions made decades ago. It quotes statistics from our health check report, but what isn’t mentioned is the finding that nature decline in national parks is happening in spite of the designation, not because of it. The key conclusion of the report is that national parks need greater power and funding in the face of the global climate and biodiversity crisis.\nIn Scotland, national parks are leading the way – Cairngorms Connect is the UK’s largest habitat restoration across 600 square kilometres. And evidence from Scottish Environment Link found that the two Scottish national parks generate more than £700m per year, investing in nature, landscape and community regeneration, supporting hundreds of jobs directly and thousands through the wider economy.\nThe UK’s first national park was established in 1951 in the Peak District by a postwar government that could see the power in protecting the nation’s finest landscapes, investing in public health and wellbeing, and regenerating rural communities. The true benefit and purpose of national park designation is to create a legacy. The challenge facing a government designating new national parks is in creating the space for informed and curious debate, focusing on what unites us rather than divides us.\nDr Rose O’Neill\nChief executive, Campaign for National Parks",

The Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said that was 8C hotter than the average for the time of year.\n“We’re expecting quite a lot of dry weather, increasing amounts of sunshine as we head through the next few days,” she said. “By Wednesday, we’re looking at highs of about 17C in the south. And then on Thursday, we could get as high as 19C.”\nThat temperature is estimated to be hotter than in Ibiza, which is forecast to have highs of 17C on Thursday, while Corfu is forecast to have highs of 16C.\nHowever, the start of the week in the UK will still feel chilly, with some overnight frost, the forecaster said.\n“So the temperatures we have got currently are around average, which is about 10C. But we’ve also got quite a chilly wind at the moment, so it’s making it feel even colder,” Mitchell said.\n“But by the time we get to Wednesday and Thursday, temperatures will be about eight degrees above average in some places. The spring equinox will coincide with some nice warm weather, definitely feeling spring-like.”\nThe expected higher temperatures will be due to a large area of high pressure, which tends to bring dry and sunny weather.\nThe warmest air will be in southern parts of the UK, Mitchell said.\n“Parts of the south-east [and] across the Midlands will be the warmest spots on Wednesday, and then on Thursday that warmth travels a bit further north, so it’s going to feel pretty warm across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland and the whole of England and Wales.\n“There’s really just northern Scotland that will keep hold of the colder weather through the middle of the week.”",

      "content_en": "Edinburgh’s Royal Mile and its surrounding streets are not short of monuments. In a 30-minute round trip, visitors can rub the nose of Greyfriars Bobby, spit on the Heart of Midlothian and touch David Hume’s toe, all thought to bring good luck. On the way, they might stop for a selfie with Wojtek the Bear, an honorary member of the Polish army who went on to live in Edinburgh Zoo, while the Scott Monument, built to honour Sir Walter, looms overhead.\nAccording to campaigners, though, there is something missing: women. There are no freestanding statues of women in the city centre, and only a handful in the surrounding area. So when a fundraiser was launched in 2017 to secure a Royal Mile statue for Elsie Inglis, Scottish suffragist and maternal health pioneer, it quickly gained momentum. But when plans were finally unveiled last month, a bitter row was reignited about the choice of a male sculptor and his vision for the statue.\nThe dispute began in 2022 when the charity Statue For Elsie Inglis suddenly cancelled an open call for designs by artists for the future monument, and instead announced the appointment of Alexander Stoddart, who holds the title of the King’s Sculptor in Ordinary in Scotland and whose existing works include five statues in Edinburgh city centre, two of them – of David Hume and Adam Smith – on the Royal Mile. The backlash was so forceful that all but one of the charity’s trustees resigned.\nView image in fullscreen A sketch of the proposed monument to Dr Elsie Inglis on the southern pavement of the Royal Mile. Illustration: The City of Edinburgh Council\nAfter the official planning application was submitted a few weeks ago, opposition has continued to grow. By Friday morning, the application had amassed 163 comments from the public. Among those who have objected is Margaret Graham, Labour councillor for the proposed site, who told the Observer the design was “dowdy and not representative of the character of Elsie Inglis”. She called for further public consultation before a final decision was made.\nNatasha Phoenix, a feminist sculptor and campaigner who led opposition to Stoddart’s appointment in 2022, said the commission was “a cultural embarrassment” and should have been given to a woman. Stoddart, she said, has “no links to feminism or to Elsie Inglis”.\nPhoenix, who had planned to enter the original competition before it was closed, said: “It’s incredibly important that women’s stories are told through the female gaze. When men create sculptures of women, they often portray them through the patriarchal lens, whether intentionally or not.”\nInglis, one of the first women to graduate from Edinburgh University, founded a free hospital and milk bank for Edinburgh’s poorest women and children, and was active in the suffrage movement. When war broke out in 1914, she established a fleet of women-run field hospitals and served as a medic for three years.\nThe Inglis statue is set to be located at the site of her maternity hospital but Stoddart’s proposed design, revealed last month, depicts her in military uniform, standing upright and alone on a tall pedestal.\nPhoenix said the design “erases women’s history and lacks qualities attributed to Elsie – warmth, compassion and spirit. She existed among everyday folks and, figuratively, would never have put herself on a pedestal or above others.” Instead, Phoenix suggested, the statue should depict Inglis in a caring stance alongside a new, breastfeeding mother.\nDr Lynn McNair, a lecturer in early education at the University of Edinburgh, said she also objected and called for a child-friendly design instead of one “out of reach, physically and in representation”.\n“As a parent and educator, I’ve walked countless times up and down the High Street with a little hand tucked in mine, and I’ve seen first-hand how public art sparks children’s imagination, ignites questions and deepens their understanding of the world,” she said. “We had a chance to honour Elsie Inglis in a way that reflected her fight for women’s voices to be heard. Instead, we risk telling another story where those voices remain absent.”\nGemma Bone, a member of a Facebook group set up to campaign against the proposals, said she felt Stoddart was “an establishment male sculptor … whose agenda is to put a classical-style sculpture in a prominent place”, and that “[Inglis’s] military service, serving men, was small compared to her pioneering medical work for women and babies”.\nFor others, the issue is one of transparency. Jenny Lester, chair of Edinburgh’s International Women’s Day march, said Stoddart’s selection had been “in bad faith”.\n“For me, the problem isn’t that he’s a man but that he was selected by the trust after they said it would be a competitive process,” she added.\nAlexander Stoddart and Edinburgh council were approached for comment.\nTrustees of Statue For Elsie Inglis said in a statement that the submission of the planning application was “a significant milestone in the project to deliver a lasting tribute on the Royal Mile”.\n“The trustees continue to be committed to the delivery of this project and we hope all those who recognise the life and work of Dr Elsie Inglis will be supportive,” they said.\nBut for their opponents, the differences will be difficult to reconcile. “There are already dozens of boring, patriarchal statues on the Royal Mile that everyone walks straight past,” said one.\n“It’s an insult to Elsie and all of us to make her into another one.”\nMary Wollstonecraft\nIn 2020, Maggi Hambling’s sculpture of feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was met with criticism when it depicted her nude and as an unrecognisable “everywoman” figure. Its unveiling followed a decade-long fundraising effort by the Mary on the Green campaign, whose representatives defended the design as a modern and challenging depiction – but feminist activist Caroline Criado-Perez called it “insulting” and “a naked, perfectly formed, wet dream of a woman”.\nMillicent Fawcett\nA statue of suffragist leader Millicent Fawcett, by Turner prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing, was erected in Parliament Square after a campaign. But a few years after its unveiling in 2018, a book by professor Melissa Terras claimed the words depicted on the statue, “courage calls to courage everywhere”, had been taken out of context. Widely cited as a tribute to suffragette Emily Davison, Terras said Fawcett had not actually penned the line until years after Davison’s death, and only then to explain why her death had attracted widespread attention, rather than to celebrate her.\nVirginia Woolf\nLast year, a bust of writer Virginia Woolf in Bloomsbury was the subject of a dispute after Camden council labelled it with a QR code directing viewers to an explanation of Woolf’s “imperialist views”. The move was part of a project established in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests to “make meaningful connections between our diverse communities and Camden’s public realm,” the council said. Woolf’s great-niece Emma Woolf slammed the decision, calling Camden council “the wokerati”.",

Sharma tried to discuss it with the captain of the Noordzee. “I told him, ‘This is not my ship.

When the boat docked at Portsmouth, immigration officers were waiting and Sharma and the others were taken to a police station. “The police said to me, can you explain everything that has happened to you? They said, ‘We are with you. You are in the UK, a safe country.’”\nSharma was recognised as a victim of modern slavery by the Home Office and agreed to help police by giving evidence in a criminal case. “I wanted to stay in the UK until I got justice,” he says.\nSharma appeared on a BBC documentary, Disclosure: Slavery at Sea, which broadcast in 2024. The BBC, which also ran a radio documentary on the issue, revealed he was one of 35 men who worked on vessels owned by TN Trawlers and its sister companies, owned by the Nicholson family, and were recognised as victims of modern slavery between 2012 and 2020.\nBut justice has been elusive. TN Trawlers and its associated companies were the subject of two lengthy criminal investigations, but no cases of human trafficking or modern slavery have come to trial, although some of the men waited years to give evidence.\nThe Crown Office in Scotland acknowledges that Sharma is a victim of a crime. But the criminal investigation into what happened to him was dropped after he could not identify the perpetrators in a video.\nNow, after years of helping the authorities in Scotland, Sharma is facing deportation back to India, where he fears his life is in danger. Word got back to his agents in Mumbai that he had spoken to the police, he claims. His father was assaulted by the agents, he says, and he has received death threats. He has suffered bouts of depression.\nView image in fullscreen Vishal and Sukhdeep Sharma at home in Bradford with their son, Humraj. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer\nWhile in this legal limbo, he has built a life for himself in Bradford. He worked fitting shop fronts and married Sukhdeep, 27, a business student and Indian national. In December 2020, they had a son, Humraj.\n“She’s my wife, my best friend, she has given me moral support,” he says.\nIn a letter sent to Sharma and his family in February, the Home Office rejected their asylum claims and told them to leave the UK. It said: “It is considered that any subjective fear you may have of returning to India is not objectively well-founded.”\nJoy Gillespie, the CEO of Survivors of Human Trafficking in Scotland, an NGO that has supported many of the 35 migrant fishers who appeared on the BBC’s documentary, says: “These men have done everything they could to help make a prosecution happen. But when it doesn’t work out, they are of no value and they are left in the lurch. If we are to bring these difficult trafficking prosecutions, we have to be more victim focused and give them our support.”\nChris Williams, of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), says fishing is a “blind spot” for potential labour exploitation of migrant workers. The system ties them to one vessel, where they are at the mercy of the skipper.\n“Unfortunately, what happened to Vishal and others could happen again,” Williams says. The ITF is calling for fishers to be included in the Fair Work Agency, a new state enforcement agency being proposed in the government’s employment rights bill going through parliament.\nView image in fullscreen The BBC documentary Slavery at Sea featured migrant workers who worked on vessels owned by TN Trawlers and its sister companies. Photograph: BBC\nStephanie Hill and Carolin Ott, solicitors for Leigh Day, are investigating a number of claims for other exploited migrant fishers.\n“We are concerned that the exploitation of migrant fishers and seafarers for the purposes of forced labour and other forms of modern slavery are not being properly investigated by the police and the Home Office, who have a duty to investigate instances and risks of trafficking and forced labour,” they say.\nOn Sharma’s case, a spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service says: “The case was carefully considered and a decision was taken that we could not prosecute due to insufficient evidence. The findings of an independent review supported the original decision. Further areas of investigation were identified and are under consideration.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office says the government is determined to tackle “the scourge of modern slavery” but adds: “The right to claim asylum in the UK is an entirely separate process from the support an individual may be entitled to as a victim of modern slavery.”\nThe Guardian was told that TN Trawlers no longer exists. A legal representative of the TN group said they did not wish to comment on this article.\nLast year, a spokesperson for TN Group told the BBC it disputed suggestions that workers were mistreated or were victims of modern slavery.\nThe spokesperson said it always provided food and accommodation to workers and that they were “always free to come and go when ashore”.\n“The overwhelming experience of our workers was that they were well treated and well remunerated. We dispute many of the accounts put to us, in some cases over a decade on.\n“We absolutely refute any allegation of modern slavery or human trafficking and our many testimonials and long-term employees are testament to that.”",

      "content_en": "Nicola Sturgeon must be sick of the sight of her own obituaries. Since she confirmed on Wednesday that she will not seek re-election as a MSP at next May’s Holyrood elections, ending a 27-year career in frontline politics, the Scottish media has overflowed with assessments of the legacy and greatest hits of the country’s first female and longest serving first minister.\nAlthough the decision came as no surprise, given her increasingly infrequent appearances at the Scottish parliament, her departure seems a good time to consider what she did and the imprint she has left on the recent history and future trajectory of her country.\nHaving reported on Sturgeon for over a decade, I remember the deafening roars of the crowd at Glasgow’s 12,000-seater Hydro arena, which she sold out in 2014 – like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé – a few weeks after her election as SNP leader. I remember a round table on energy policy, where she made sure that the only young woman in the room got a chance to speak. I remember her reddening face and wobbly lip last year as she struggled to contain her emotion under questioning at the UK Covid-19 inquiry.\nAn introvert with down-to-earth charm, she was – and still is among many in the SNP and the wider Scottish public – adored, a progressive ally and advocate in private as well as public. Her greatest gift is the ability to speak human when all around her just look to be touting for votes.\nAt the age of 54 – with eight years on our prime minister and still relatively young in terms of political careers – talk of legacy can feel premature. It is certainly fluid, with the Branchform inquiry into SNP finances, which saw her arrested a few months after she resigned as first minister in 2023, ongoing and her soon to be ex-husband, Peter Murrell, charged with alleged embezzlement.\nSince her announcement, posted on her current favoured social media platform, Instagram, the Holyrood opposition has taken the opportunity to cast her legacy as one dominated by division and failure. But that is less than half the story.\nCertainly Sturgeon benefited electorally from the Yes/No split that followed the 2014 referendum, with independence voters uniting behind the SNP, and supporters of the union split between other parties. It took another 10 years for the link between constitutional preference and ballot box to uncouple, resulting in the SNP’s catastrophic defeat in last July’s general election at the hands of a resurgent Scottish Labour. (Since then, Labour has squandered its advantage and the SNP is leading the polls for Holyrood again.)\nBut her own political standing suffered because of that same division – those who loved her were unwilling to hold her to account, while those who loathed her refused to acknowledge her many assets.\nIt was this capacity to polarise that Sturgeon herself identified as one of her reasons for stepping down as first minister. But it was plain that she was also spent after a gruelling run of challenges, including the Covid pandemic, the Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government’s handling of sexual assault allegations against her predecessor Alex Salmond, and the controversy around her flagship gender recognition reforms.\nThroughout the pandemic, Sturgeon was admired across the UK for her straightforward and reassuring communication, yet the UK Covid inquiry exposed a significant lack of transparency behind this, bypassing cabinet decision-making and mass deletion of informal messages. It underlined her hyper-controlled, presidential style of leadership and its brutal self-imposed toll, with Sturgeon unable to allow herself even a day off.\nWith the Salmond inquiry – as with her husband and former SNP chief executive Murrell – some felt a woman was being unfairly held responsible for the alleged actions of a man – but self-evidently this woman was also in charge of her government and at the epicentre of party decision-making for decades. Likewise, both she and Murrell failed to recognise the almighty potential conflict that having a married couple at the head of a governing party represented.\nShe was badly hurt by accusations of betraying feminism over her gender recognition reforms, which she could not have foreseen would coalesce around a global culture war when she first proposed them as a natural progression from the introduction of equal marriage. But her refusal to entertain those, even within her own party, worried about the potential scope of self-identification left her exposed.\nSturgeon herself has said the introduction of the Scottish child payment, the expansion of free childcare and support for youngsters in care are among her proudest achievements. Critics point to failures to tackle the attainment gap or drug deaths, timidity in taking on vested interests over NHS reform, and also her unwillingness to build on the broad coalition gifted by the Yes movement after the referendum.\nSomething that even admirers of Sturgeon have always wrestled with was the space between rhetoric and reality in the SNP government – or, as an anti-poverty campaigner said to me: “Does it matter that witches have been pardoned if you don’t know what you’re going to feed your child tomorrow?” Despite some excellent policy progress on violence against women and child poverty, for example, third sector leaders would highlight a significant implementation gap: like the extended childcare, which ended up a postcode lottery, with extra hours at work-unfriendly times.\nSpeaking to younger activists, it’s clear that the sheer symbolism of Sturgeon’s tenure inspired generations. Her legacy is as much in what she made visible and normal. She proved it was possible to govern in an entirely different tone of voice from the Tory bombast at Westminster: speaking out against Trump, happily describing herself as a feminist, championing the transformative power of reading. She spoke too about miscarriage, the menopause, fostering – and while having a political leader talk about those topics on Loose Women is not a silver bullet to systemic inequality, it mattered.\nPerhaps it was inevitable that the first of her kind would end up unable to fulfil the weight of expectation. It is worth keeping in mind too that the party she led is united by its desire for independence, not centre-left social policy.\nFor now, Sturgeon’s Instagram followers can see her enjoying the “ordinary stuff that most people take for granted”, which she referenced in her resignation speech as having become increasingly out of her reach. Although for Sturgeon this involves hanging out with the tartan A-list, DJing with Hollywood star Alan Cumming and hosting books events with her old pal and crime-writing doyenne Val McDermid.\nMeanwhile, those obituary writers – me included – await the publication of her “deeply personal” memoir later this year with some anticipation about the revelations it may contain. I doubt these will be the last words to be written about a woman who continues to fascinate, infuriate, inspire and challenge even as she steps – for now – out of the limelight.",

      "content_en": "From 13 Mar 2025 10.09 EDT Unison says handling of NHS England abolition announcement 'shambolic' Unison, which describes itself as the largest healthcare union in the UK, has described the announcement about the abolition of NHS England as “shambolic”. Christina McAnea, its general secretary, said: The health service needs thousands more staff and to be able to hold on to experienced employees. At the moment, it’s struggling to do that. Giving staff a decent pay rise would help no end. But this announcement will have left NHS England staff reeling. Just days ago they learned their numbers were to be slashed by half, now they discover their employer will cease to exist. The way the news of the axing has been handled is nothing short of shambolic. It could surely have been managed in a more sympathetic way. Share\n13 Mar 2025 13.50 EDT The health thinktanks are generally quite sceptical about the decision to abolish NHS England. But Reform, a centrist thinktank (not connected in any way to the Nigel Farage party), has welcomed the news. It posted this on Bluesky. “I don’t see why decisions about £200bn of taxpayers money... on something as fundamental to our security as the NHS should be taken by an ALB, NHS England”\nExcellent to hear the PM commit to abolishing NHS England... as we recommended last year. And here is the Reform report from last year in which it called for this. Share\n13 Mar 2025 13.41 EDT Kemi Badenoch dismisses Reform's claim they will beat Tories in next year's Scottish elections Libby Brooks Libby Brooks is the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent. It is “not a fait accompli” that Reform will finish ahead of the Scottish Conservatives at the next Holyrood election, Kemi Badenoch has told reporters in Glasgow. After a visit to BAE Systems in Glasgow, the UK Tory leader, on her first visit north of the border since her election last November, said: We are the most successful political party in the history of Western democracy. The idea that we’re suddenly going to disappear, just because there’s competition on the right is just not serious. We have just been kicked out of government. Of course, people will go to protest parties until they are clear about where we’re going and until we have rebuilt trust. Responding specifically to the claim by Reform’s Richard Tice, visiting Glasgow last week, that his party would do better than the Scottish Tories in next May’s Scottish parliament elections, she said: It’s not a fait accompli, voting Reform just helps the SNP, so anyone who is a unionist, anyone who is on the right, voting Reform is just going to get more leftwing governments, and that’s what we saw at the last election. She also denied that the debate about single sex spaces was toxic, saying: There are some people who have decided to make it an issue of toxicity. I don’t think that it is a toxic debate. I think it is an honest debate. We can’t be afraid to tell the truth. And she reprimanded reporters asking why it had taken her so long to visit Scotland since her election for trying to present her as an alien. The constant trying to present the Conservative party leader, or the prime minister of the United Kingdom, as something alien to the country is quite wrong, and we should stop doing that. Share\n13 Mar 2025 13.29 EDT DWP admits 70% of rise in number of people getting top rate of universal credit for sick/disabled not anticipated The Department for Work and Pensions has published new figures highlighting the sharp rise in the number of people claiming the top rate of universal credit for people with sickness or a disability. It says there are now 1.8 million people in this category – up from 1.4 million a year ago. At the start of the pandemic there were only 360,000 people in this category, the DWP says. The DWP says that some of the increase were expected, because sick and disabled people were migrating to universal credit from other benefits, but 70% of the increase was not expected by the department. It says the UK is the only G7 country with higher levels of economic activity than before Covid. People on the top rate receive their benefits without being expected to look for work and in its news release the DWP says: “1.8 million people on universal credit are getting no support to find work.” But an alternative interpretation would be that 1.8 million people who have declared an illness or disability are getting top-up out-of-work benefit payments. People who claim universal credit because they are not working as a result of a health condition or a disability are subject to a work capability assessment (WCA). People assessed as being capable of working at some point in the future are put in the limited capability for work (LCW) category and expected to take part in activities that will help them find a job in the future. But people considered unable to prepare for work are categorised as limited capability for work-related activity (LCWRA) and it is this group where the caseload has risen up to 1.8m. In its news release, published alongside a report setting out the latest quarterly statistics for these benefits, the DWP explains how a LCWRA assessment leads to higher benefits. The current system, in which people 25 and over on the standard rate of UC get £393.45 a month and those with a health condition get an additional £416.19, gives an incentive for people to say they can’t work – and get locked out of help and support – simply to get by financially. Over the past five years, 67% of people on universal credit who have been through a WCA were considered LCWRA - a symptom of the assessment system pushing people to prove their inability to work for a more generous payout. The DWP also says young people are increasingly being assessed as LCWRA. The number of young people aged 16 to 24 on LCWRA has risen by 249% from 46,000 to 160,000 since the pandemic – demonstrating a worrying increase in the number people becoming trapped in inactivity early in life, with almost one million young people not in education, employment, or training. It also says these figures show the WCA process is “broken”. In a statement Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, said these figures showed that people are being “locked out of work by a failing welfare system which abandons people - when we know there are at least 200,000 people who want to work, and are crying out for the right support and a fair chance”. Next week the DWP is due to publish its plans to change the way sickness and disability benefits are paid.

PA says: Some 71 youths under 21 were arrested for terrorist-related activity in 2024, up from 69 the previous year and 60 in 2022, according to Home Office figures. It is the highest annual number since 77 arrests in 2017, the year of the Manchester Arena suicide bombing, which left 22 dead and more than a thousand injured, along with other terror attacks that claimed lives in Westminster, London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green in London. The data shows that of 71 under-21s arrested last year, 32 were aged 18-20, up from 26 in 2023, while 39 were under the age of 18, down slightly year-on-year from 43. Share\n13 Mar 2025 12.05 EDT Ed Balls says cutting benefits for most vulnerable 'is not going to work' and is 'not Labour thing to do' Ed Balls, the former Labour shadow chancellor, has said the government would be wrong to cut disability benefits for the most vulnerable people in society. He was speaking in the latest episode of Political Currency, the podcast he co-hosts with George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor, who said that when he was at the Treasury he ruled out freezing Pip (the personal independence payment – a disability benefit) because he thought that was not very fair. Next week the government is due to announce major cuts to sickness and disability benefits. The details have not not been announced, but one ITV News report last week said the Treasury wants to save up to £6bn by freezing the level at which Pip is paid (instead of uprating it in line with inflation, which normally happens with benefits), and making it harder to claim. The government wants to get more people off benefits and into work, but ITV said “even those with extreme disabilities in the unfit to work category are likely to lose money”. Balls said: It’s one thing to say the economy is not doing well and we’ve got a fiscal challenge … but cutting the benefits of the most vulnerable in our society who can’t work to pay for that - is not going to work. And it’s not a Labour thing to do … It’s not what they’re for. Balls was a major figure in the Blair/Brown government, as Gordon Brown’s chief adviser and then as a cabinet minister. But he lost his seat as an MP in 2015 and he now works as a TV presenter and podcaster. He is married to Yvette Cooper, the current home secretary. In the same episode Osborne implied that, if Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, does decide to freeze Pip, she will be acting even more harshly than he did. He said: I didn’t freeze Pip. I thought [it] would not be regarded as very fair. Osborne said he did try to cut eligibility for Pip in his 2016 budget, hoping to save £4bn, “which I guess, adjusting for inflation, is roughly what Labour is looking for now”. But Iain Duncan Smith, the then welfare secretary, resigned in protest, “and I had to back down”, Osborne said.

In its report on the NHS England performance figures out today, PA says: Data released today shows 73.4% of patients in England urgently referred for suspected cancer were diagnosed or had cancer ruled out within 28 days in January. This is down from 78.1% the previous month and is the lowest figure since April 2024, as well as being below the government target of 75%. The government and NHS England have set a new target of March 2026 for this figure to reach 80%. In addition, the proportion of patients who had waited no longer than 62 days in January from an urgent suspected cancer referral, or consultant upgrade, to their first definitive treatment for cancer was 67.3%, down from 71.3%. The government and NHS England have set a target of March 2026 for this figure to reach 75%. Elsewhere, the NHS England figures show the overall waiting list for planned hospital treatments has fallen for the fifth month in a row. (See 9.53am.) A total of 198,868 people in England had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start routine hospital treatment at the end of January, down from 200,375 at the end of December and the lowest number since November 2020. In addition, 73.4% of patients in A&E were seen within four hours in February, up from 73% in January. The number of people waiting more than 12 hours in A&E departments in England from a decision to admit to actually being admitted also stood at 47,623 in February, down from a record 61,529 in January. In its own news release on today’s figures, NHS England presents a different take. It says: NHS staff have more than halved the average wait for tests and checks since the height of the pandemic as the waiting list continues to fall, new data shows today.\nPatients were waiting an average of 17 days for tests and checks in January – 43 days less than at the height of the pandemic (May 2020). Average waits for tests are now the lowest since 2.1 weeks in February 2020. Share Updated at 11.45 EDT\n13 Mar 2025 11.22 EDT The Health Foundation, another leading thinktank, has joined the King’s Fund and the Nuffield Trust in suggesting that that the gains to be had from abolishing NHS England may not justify the disruption it will cause. (See 3.02pm.) This is from Hugh Alderwick, director of policy at foundation. There is some logic in bringing the workings of NHS England and the government more closely together – for example, to help provide clarity to the health service on priorities for improvement. And – in reality – it is impossible to take politics out of the NHS. But history tells us that rejigging NHS organisations is hugely distracting and rarely delivers the benefits politicians expect. Scrapping NHS England completely will cause disruption and divert time and energy of senior leaders at a time when attention should be focused on improving care for patients. It will also eat up the time of ministers, with new legislation likely needed. Share\n13 Mar 2025 11.08 EDT Nick Davies, programme director at the Institute for Government thinktank, is also sceptical about the need to abolish NHS England. He has posted these on Bluesky. There’s a decent case for scrapping NHS England but doing so is a major change programme that will take up substantial ministerial and official time. Hard to see how govt can do this while also making good progress on meeting the 18 week target AND the three shifts ahead of the next election. Less than six months ago, Streeting said top-down reorganisation was the ‘last thing’ he wanted to do. What’s changed since then? All of the problems cited have been evident for years. Why has it taken 9 months in office for Labour to make such a monumental decision? Streeting has just told the Commons that while much of this can be done without legislation, a bill is needed. And that the whole process of merging DHSC and NHSE is likely to take 2 years. Even if it’s the right long term decision this will be hugely disruptive in the short term Share\n13 Mar 2025 11.03 EDT Leading health thinktanks say, while they can see case for abolishing NHS England, benefits for patients might be modest Two of the leading health thinktanks in the UK have said that, while they can see the case for abolishing NHS England, the benefits for patients might be modest In a statement, Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of the King’s Fund, said: Today’s announcement lands on the same day that NHS stats show people continue to wait days in A&E and many patients remain stuck in hospital beds despite being well enough to leave. The most important question is how will the abolition of NHS England make it easier for people to get a GP appointment, shorten waits for planned care and improve people’s health? That hasn’t yet been set out – ministers will need to explain how the prize will be worth the price. It is absolutely right that democratically elected politicians must have clear oversight of how the NHS delivers for patients and spends hundreds of billions of taxpayer money. It is also reasonable to want to deliver better value by reducing duplication and waste between two national bodies where they are performing a similar role. It is true that over its just over a decade of existence, NHS England has been asked to take on a lot more additional power, functions and therefore staff, than it was originally designed to do. Having now made the decision to abolish NHS England, and while we still wait for the publication of the NHS 10 Year Plan, the government must be clear why this significant structural change at this time is necessary, and how it fits into their wider plans. The potential cost savings would be minimal in the context of the entire NHS budget, and so they must ensure that the changes produce the improved effectiveness which is sought by making this change. And Thea Stein, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said: Today’s news will be devastating for staff at all levels of NHS England, and we must remain mindful of the human cost of this decision. With the public finances under extraordinary pressure it does, however, make sense to remove the duplication and bureaucracy that exists currently – and patients and the public are probably not going to shed many tears over the shifting of power from an arm’s-length body into central government. But profound problems facing the NHS remain: how to meet growing patient need in the face of spiralling waiting lists and how to invest in care closer to home with the NHS’s wider finances already underwater and social care reform in the long grass. It is not immediately clear that rearranging the locus of the power at the top will make a huge and immediate difference to these issues, which ultimately will be how patients and the public judge the government.

      "content_en": "Scotland’s first minister hosted a “warm” meeting with Donald Trump’s son Eric in Edinburgh on Thursday, days after the US president’s golf course at Turnberry was targeted by protesters.\nJohn Swinney met Eric Trump at his official residence, a listed Georgian townhouse in Edinburgh’s New Town, for what both sides described as a routine business meeting that focused on the Trump family’s golfing interests.\nScottish officials suspect the US president will visit Scotland this summer to open a second championship course at his smaller golf resort in Aberdeenshire. That opening event, expected in June, was touched on during the meeting, but a presidential visit was not discussed.\nThe meeting, which is Swinney’s first with any member of the Trump family, took place amid rising tensions between the UK and the White House over the Trump administration’s stance on Ukraine and the punitive tariffs it has introduced, including on British steel and aluminium.\nThe visit suggests Trump is keen to restore friendly links with Scotland, where he owns the Turnberry golfing resort in Ayrshire and a boutique hotel and golf course north of Aberdeen.\nEric Trump, the organisation’s executive vice-president, said: “I’m delighted to say that it was a very warm and friendly meeting and this is the first time that a first minister has invited us to Bute House.\n“The first minister thanked me for the Trump Organization’s ongoing colossal investment and commitment to Scotland. This is the first time that I’ve heard those words from the first minister and they were hugely appreciated.”\nSwinney’s spokesperson insisted there was nothing unusual about the event. “This is not a political meeting, it’s a business meeting,” he said. “We are trying to act as a responsible government would and treat business figures in the same way.”\nLorna Slater, the Scottish Greens’ co-leader, said the meeting was “a bad call that sends a terrible message”.\n“When it comes to the Trumps, the line between business and politics has always been blurred.\n“Eric Trump is not a normal businessman. He is a rightwing extremist that has peddled misinformation and conspiracy theories. He is a figurehead for an administration that is wrecking our planet while cosying up to Vladimir Putin and showing total contempt for human rights and democracy.”\nUntil now, Donald Trump has had a chilly relationship with the Scottish government. He publicly fell out with the former first minister Alex Salmond over the latter’s backing for offshore windfarms near Trump’s Aberdeenshire course.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s Westminster leader, said on X that the prime minister “better get back up off his knees and revoke that offer of a state visit”.\nSwinney has rejected those challenges, and told MSPs at Holyrood last week that the state visit should only be reconsidered if Trump continued to threaten and undermine the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Otherwise, he said, Starmer’s offer of a second state visit was prudent given the seriousness of the crisis in Ukraine.\nEric Trump is also expected to visit Turnberry, where pro-Palestinian activists heavily damaged parts of his golf course and sprayed pro-Gaza protest slogans on the grass on Saturday.",

      "content_en": "Musicians and artists should challenge disinformation and cynicism in global politics by standing up for fundamental truths, the violinist Nicola Benedetti has said.\nBenedetti, the director of the Edinburgh international festival, said the arts played an essential role during periods of turmoil by showing the best of human achievement.\n“We’re currently caught in a bewildering swirl of truth and alternative fact and manipulated language disguised as information,” she said, as she announced this year’s programme, the theme of which is “the truth we seek”.\nSpeaking after the launch, Benedetti acknowledged she was referring to the crises that have erupted since Donald Trump resumed the US presidency. “There’s no point downplaying the presence of the United States [here]. Everyone is watching and there are huge tectonic shifts and enormous questions facing leadership and political leadership at the moment,” she said.\n“But we have an advantage with the arts in that we can speak that language of allegory. We can speak to both pertinent and timeless issues at once, [so] now is the time to double down on exactly that.”\nThe opening event features a marathon eight-hour performance at the Usher Hall of Sir John Tavener’s religious song cycle The Veil of the Temple, which Benedetti said spoke to the role religious belief played in illuminating universal truths.\nBeing staged for the first time in the UK in 20 years, it features 250 singers from several companies singing about the Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist faiths in five languages, including Aramaic and Church Slavonic.\nThe following day the Usher Hall will host 120 teenage musicians from the NYO2 youth orchestra based at Carnegie Hall in New York, who start a three-year festival residency this year, as well as 20 young Scottish musicians. They will collaborate in a family concert that afternoon, followed by a performance of Prokofiev’s fifth symphony.\nBenedetti said grand scale and mass participation were central to the festival’s ethos. In another event, chamber musicians with the Aga Khan music programme would jam on the spot, with audience members able to request pieces of music.\nShe said: “We are committed to infusing a relatable, casual, open and trusting vibe into everything we do, in spirit and in action.” That would include again selling about 50,000 tickets for £30 or less, alongside £10 offers and half-price tickets for teenagers.\nOther notable events, she said, included the premiere of a new play starring the Succession actor Brian Cox, satirising the Scottish banker Fred Goodwin and his role in the 2008 financial crisis, with Cox playing the ghost of the economist Adam Smith.\nThere is also a new Scottish Ballet production on the feud between Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I, featuring punk couture costumes, stilts and a male dancer at times playing Elizabeth; an Australian production of the opera Orpheus and Eurydice, featuring a contemporary circus company and video projections; and the premiere of a hip-hop interpretation of JS Bach’s work featuring dancers from Acland Burghley school in north London and 18th-century period instruments.\nThis year’s festival would be smaller than previous years, Benedetti said, because of funding cuts, with contemporary music and opera pared back.\nSpeaking in January, Benedetti expressed alarm about the threat to Scottish arts from cuts in government and philanthropic funding. But she said a subsequent award to the festival of £11.75m over the next three years, part of a £200m nationwide funding package from Creative Scotland, was “pivotal”.\nShe said she hoped three-year funding pledges would be honoured. “You have to proceed with a level of confidence and plan ambitiously, but you also hope for a level of non-partisan integrity around promises made,” she said.\nThe Edinburgh international festival runs from 1 to 25 August and tickets go on general sale on 27 March via eif.co.uk.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They controlled the game even when we had the ball, so we need to do more in that sense as well.”\nThe Scots went into Sunday’s second leg buoyed by a three-match winning streak and a four-game unbeaten run in which they had conceded only one goal.\nMcLean, who won his 50th cap, admitted they need to sharpen up significantly over the summer as they prepare to face Greece again in their 2026 World Cup qualification campaign later this year.\n“Especially the way we’ve been going and the way we’ve always acquitted ourselves, I think when you do put a performance in so disappointing, it does surprise you a bit,” said McLean.\n“It’s one we need to learn from, because we play Greece in the World Cup qualifiers, so we now know how good they are.\n“They are a really good team, but as I said, we gave them a lot tonight. We’ve got a couple of games in the summer (against Iceland and Liechtenstein) that we can really work together and try and get better and improve.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Scotland head coach Steve Clarke hopes there is a silver lining from their heavy home defeat by Greece after appearing to learn immediate lessons.\nClarke’s side were relegated from the top tier of the Nations League after losing 3-0 in their play-off second leg at Hampden.\nScotland had gone into the game on a high after winning 1-0 in the away leg on Thursday but they were two down on aggregate inside 46 minutes and never looked like getting back into the game.\nRyan Christie returned from suspension to replace Lewis Ferguson but Clarke otherwise kept the same team that played in Piraeus while Greece made six changes including handing a debut to 17-year-old goalscorer Konstantinos Karetsas, whose half-time introduction had inspired Greece on Thursday.\n“We didn’t have enough energy in the team,” Clarke said. “Greece had more energy. They were a little bit sharper. The best team won on the night.”\nScotland also travel to Greece in the World Cup qualifiers on November 15 and Clarke hinted he would look at making more changes before their final group game at Hampden three days later.\nWhen asked if he might have freshened things up more, Clarke said: “It’s possible. With hindsight, everything’s possible. The boys assured me they were all fit and well.\n“I think the first goal gave them a lift. Their first dangerous foray forward, they scored with that. After that, it became a long night for us. I could have done with a few more legs on the team, to be honest.\n“It might work in our favour, actually, because we have to do a similar trip in November out to Greece.\n“It may be something to look at, the fact that you go out there, you put in a big shift out there, you have the long travel back. Maybe we weren’t quite recovered in time for the game. Not everybody, but some people.\n“It’s something that I can certainly look at and try and address.”\nScotland started on the front foot with Scott McTominay looking dangerous but a lack of tracking back cost them as they conceded two first-half goals. A loose pass from Christie then gifted Greece a third.\nClarke said: “I thought the back four did reasonably OK. I was disappointed with the defending of the team. We defended as a team from back to front on Thursday night in Greece. We didn’t do that in this game and that’s why we got punished.”\nClarke added: “Greece came here and laid down a marker. We know what to expect when they come back in October. We’ll be ready.\n“To finish such a positive Nations League campaign on such a low note and such a poor performance is something that will hurt the players. We’ve got plenty of time to stew on it before our next competitive game.\n“We’ve got two friendlies in June. We have to address one or two things and try to be better going forward.”\nIt was a record fifth consecutive away win for Greece, whose starting line-up had an average age of less than 23.\nHead coach Ivan Jovanovic said: “The expectations have continued to increase but the team is continuing to meet them.\n“We have a young group of players but the future is in their hands. I feel I am fortunate to have these young players available.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Scotland have suffered relegation in the Nations League after a 3-0 home defeat to Greece saw them lose their crucial play-off tie.\nThe national team had a 1-0 advantage from the first leg in Athens on Thursday but put in a lacklustre performance and were swept aside by an energetic Greek side.\nThe 3-1 aggregate defeat means Scotland have lost their League A status and will be in the second tier of the Nations League when they return to the competition next year.\nSteve Clarke decided to keep faith with the side that had earned that first-leg lead, making only one change to his starting line-up as Ryan Christie returned from suspension to replace Lewis Ferguson.\nThe manager was hoping to make the most of home advantage and find the goal that would pile pressure on Greece and make their tasks more difficult, and Scotland were on the front foot in the opening exchanges. Che Adams appealed for a penalty after a challenge in the box, then Scott McTominay had a chance saved and then a shot that nicked off a defender and rippled the side netting.\nGreece played their way into the game though, and scored with their first threatening attack after 20 minutes.\nGeorgios Vagiannidis burst down the right flank and cut the ball back into the Scotland box where Giannis Konstantelies was unmarked and able to guide a first-time finish past Craig Gordon from 10 yards out to level the tie.\nScotland looked to regain the lead quickly and John McGinn forced a save from Kostas Tzolakis after McTominay had sliced his initial effort.\nThe visitors were enjoying more of the ball though, and attacked with more energy. It paid off when they took the lead just before half-time.\nKonstantinos Karetskas was the standout player of the second half in the first leg and the 17-year-old showed his quality on his first start. Konstantelias picked him out with a pass in the box and the teenager cooly lifted the ball into the top corner of the net.\nScotland came out after the break needing something to turn their way but instead found themselves trailing further almost immediately.\nAfter just 15 seconds of play, Konstantelias pounced on a misplaced pass from Ryan Christie, played in Christos Tzolis and the winger finished cleanly to give his side a comfortable lead.\nScotland couldn’t muster a response despite a raft of changes and no little effort. The home crowd’s dissatisfaction became more vocal as the second half went on with no sign of the tie being reduced.\nThe final whistle confirmed Scotland’s relegation and boos from the crowd followed the players as they headed for the tunnel.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

It aims to provide peer support for the mental wellbeing of the wider farming industry and their families.\nKevin Gilbert is one of the farmers behind the initiative and understands first-hand some of the challenges.\n“You can’t take a day off, so you just get up and keep going,” he told STV News.\n“For years and years, I was like that. Every year I would take anti-depressants. When the change of season happens in the spring and the daylight lengthens you think ‘I feel better now’.\n“At the same time, when you’ve been combining busy harvesting you feel worthwhile and then you have all this backlog of office work which has built up and you go into an isolated office on your own and then start feeling down about things.”\nThe new service aims to listen and support, and says it will stand together with farmers to ensure they never face challenges alone. And now Kevin is encouraging others to speak out.\n‘‘You speak to family members, and they can’t get their sibling or partner or husband or wife to contact anybody and can’t get them to go to the doctor,’’ he added.\n‘‘We would hope that we could be that person that people could reach out and get them on the road to recovery.’’\nSince opening the mental health charity Men United, Sandy Garvock has helped to support almost 1,000 people and says 38 lives have been saved.\nComing from a farming background, he knew more support was needed for the community.\n“I felt that farmers needed somebody to speak to. Farming is a very isolated industry, when I was on the farm, I was doing 15 hours a day, seven days a week on a tractor on my own,” he said.\n“Farmers need somebody who understands and listens to what they are saying, and that’s why we launched FarmTalk,” Sandy said.\nLorna Paterson, a regional manager for NFU Scotland, says more services like this are needed now more than ever before.\n“Politics and obviously the weather plays a huge part in everybody’s life but particularly farming and for the farmers when things aren’t going well because they work on their own, they feel they have nobody to speak to,” Lorna said.\n‘‘For the farming community because they are on their own and because they have that steadfast resilient image, they feel they have to live up to that.’’\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

Greece are, coincidentally, one of the teams Scotland will face, alongside Belarus and Denmark or Portugal.\nClarke and his players are only focused on Sunday evening’s match though, and the national team boss has named the side he thinks can deliver a win.\nCraig Gordon continues in goal behind an unchanged back four of captain Andy Robertson, Grant Hanley, John Souttar and Anthony Ralston.\nKenny McLean and Billy Gilmour anchor the midfield, with Christie, Scott McTominay and John McGinn all playing behind Che Adams.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Pope Francis returned home to the Vatican from hospital on Sunday after surviving a five-week, life-threatening bout of pneumonia, making a surprise stop at his favourite basilica on the way home before beginning two months of prescribed rest and recovery.\nThe motorcade carrying the 88-year-old pope entered the Perugino gate into Vatican City, and Francis was seen in the front passenger seat wearing nasal tubes to give him supplemental oxygen.\nDuring the trip home from Gemelli hospital, Francis took a slight detour to visit the St Mary Major basilica, where his favourite icon of the Madonna is located and where he always goes to pray after a foreign visit.\nFrancis did not leave the car, but handed a bouquet of flowers to the cardinal to place in front of the Salus populi Romani icon, a Byzantine-style painting on wood that is revered by Romans.\nEarlier, before he left the hospital, the pontiff thumbs up and acknowledged the crowd after he was wheeled out onto the balcony overlooking Gemelli’s main entry, where hundreds of people had gathered on a brilliant Sunday morning to say goodbye.\n“I see this woman with the yellow flowers. Brava!” a tired-looking Francis said. He gave a weak sign of the cross before being wheeled back inside.\nChants of “Viva il papa!” and “Papa Francesco” erupted from the crowd, which included patients who had been wheeled outside just to catch his brief appearance.\nHis blessing came minutes before he was discharged from the hospital.\nDoctors, who announced his planned discharge at a Saturday evening news conference, said he should refrain from meeting with big groups of people or exerting himself, but that eventually he should be able to resume all his normal activities.\nHis return home, after the longest hospitalisation of his 12-year papacy and the second-longest in recent papal history, brought tangible relief to the Vatican and Catholic faithful who have been anxiously following 38 days of medical ups and downs and wondering if Francis would make it.\n“Today I feel a great joy,” said Dr Rossella Russomando, a doctor from Salerno who didn’t treat Francis but was at Gemelli on Sunday. “It is the demonstration that all our prayers, all the rosary prayers from all over the world, brought this grace.”\nAt the Vatican on a brilliant spring Sunday, pilgrims flocked as they have all year to St Peter’s Basilica to participate in the 2025 Holy Year.\nThey swarmed St Peter’s Square and progressed through the Holy Door in groups, while big TV screens in the square were turned on to broadcast Francis’s hospital greeting live.\nNo special arrangements have been made at the Domus Santa Marta, the Vatican hotel next to the basilica where Francis lives in a two-room suite on the second floor.\nFrancis will have access to supplemental oxygen and 24-hour medical care as needed, though his personal physician, Dr Luigi Carbone, said he hoped Francis would progressively need less and less assistance breathing as his lungs recover.\nWhile the pneumonia infection has been successfully treated, Francis will continue to take oral medication for quite some time to treat the fungal infection in his lungs and continue his respiratory and physical physiotherapy.\n“For three or four days he’s been asking when he can go home, so he’s very happy,” Dr Carbone said.\nThe Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on February 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened.\nDoctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and soon thereafter, pneumonia in both lungs.\nDr Sergio Alfieri, the medical and surgical chief at Gemelli who coordinated Francis’s medical team, confirmed that Francis was still having trouble speaking due to the damage to his lungs and respiratory muscles.\nBut he said such problems were normal, especially in older patients, and predicted his voice would eventually return to normal.\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to confirm any upcoming events, including a scheduled audience on April 8 with the King or Francis’s participation in Easter services at the end of the month.But Dr Carbone said he hoped Francis might be well enough to travel to Turkey at the end of May to participate in an important ecumenical anniversary.\nFrancis is also returning to the Vatican in the throes of a Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration scheduled to draw more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome this year.\nThe pope has already missed several Jubilee audiences and will presumably miss several more, but Vatican officials say his absence hasn’t significantly impacted the numbers of expected pilgrims arriving.\nOnly St John Paul II recorded a longer time in hospital in 1981, when he spent 55 days at Gemelli for minor surgery and treatment of an infection.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Former Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman has said she “absolutely” understands the anger directed at government from those who lost someone to Covid-19.\nSpeaking on the fifth anniversary of the first lockdown being announced on Sunday, Freeman reflected on the virus which claimed more than 16,000 lives in Scotland alone and the impact of government decisions.\nAt the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, the former health secretary said she made the best decisions possible with the information available at the time, but admitted that some of the decisions could be “worth reconsidering” in hindsight.\nAsked if she understands the anger felt by families, she told the BBC’s Sunday Show: “Oh, I absolutely can.\n“I absolutely can understand their anger, of course I can.\n“That doesn’t diminish their anger, nor I’d say, does it diminish what I’m saying to you.\n“I made what I believed were the best decisions with the information I had at the time and as I could improve the circumstances, I absolutely did.”\nShe added: “But there is no getting away from the fact that people died, people were harmed and there is a long-term impact.”\nPeople were affected by long Covid, bereavement and a lack of contact with loved ones, while young people missed out on celebrating key milestones, she said.\nBut Freeman acknowledged that the decision to close schools – which sent most pupils home for the majority of the early pandemic – could have been the wrong one and many of the choices made by ministers could be worth looking at again.\n“I think it’s something worth reconsidering,” she said.\n“I don’t know, because I’m not sitting now with all the information that I had then – in five years, I don’t remember it all.\n“So I can’t say for sure that was the wrong decision.”\nShe added: “Many of them are probably worth a reconsideration and there’s certainly things to be done to prepare us to be in a better starting place than we were for the next pandemic that will come along.”\nSpeaking of her personal experience of the pandemic, Freeman – who left Holyrood in 2021 – said: “I described it as two years of running anxiety… you’re always anxious.\n“There’s anxiety about everything from whether you’re making the right decisions to whether what you’ve said needs to be done is getting done.\n“Is it getting done properly? What’s going wrong that you don’t yet know about?\n“To just anxiety that everybody had about your own relatives, loved ones, how they’re all doing, hoping they don’t get ill, hoping everything will be okay for them.”\nAsked if she felt a sense of “pride”, she said instead she was “pleased with my own resilience”.\nScottish Tory health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane accused Freeman of a “shameful” attempt to defend the government’s record, adding: “The SNP were completely unprepared for Covid and were too busy playing politics against Westminster when they should have been focused on saving lives.”\nLooking at the health service currently, Freeman went on to say that a “national booking system” for elective care could go some way to relieving the pressure on Scotland’s NHS.\nBut Scottish Labour’s deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: “Under the dysfunctional SNP, operating theatres can remain underused while A&E patients wait in corridors and nearly one in six Scots are on an NHS waiting list.\n“Scottish Labour will bring a patient-first approach to our NHS where the money follows the patient rather than propping up bureaucracy and all available operating capacity is used.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

There will never be another era like it again.”\nThe broadcaster, who is now a presenter on Sky Sports show Soccer Saturday, also said that the show gave him “incredible memories that will stay with me forever,” and “took a chance on me” when he had no experience.\nReacting to Thomas’ post on X, Bacon wrote that he “loved” Blue Peter and said “being live is what made it alive”.\n“I remember walking from one side of the studio to the other – doing a piece to camera – and seeing the whole crew, five cameras, and another on a crane, track with me,” he wrote.\n“I know that doesn’t sound like much – but the first time it happened, it was mind-blowing. It was just a big, well-made, lovingly made, really well-resourced live kids TV show.\n“That had been live in that building for decades. It was a magical experience (for, you know, all of 20 months).”\nBacon was sacked from Blue Peter in the 1990s, after admitting drug taking, but did return, receiving a Blue Peter badge on the 60th anniversary.\nA BBC spokesperson said: “Blue Peter won’t just be available to view online and will remain on the CBBC and BBC Two linear channels, as well as BBC iPlayer and sign zone.\n“The programme has been a mix of live and pre-recorded shows for decades and has transitioned to a pre-record model as viewing habits change.\n“Blue Peter continues to be loved by generations across the UK.\n“As we continue to navigate a challenging market and young audience viewing habits evolve, it is necessary to make some changes to ensure that BBC Studios Kids and Family Productions delivers a dynamic, digital-first brand that will future-proof the show and sustain its legacy for years to come.”\nThe current line-up of presenters include Shini Muthukrishnan, Joel Mawhinney and Abby Cook.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Families in Tayside waiting for an autism or ADHD assessment are worried their children won’t get the support they need.\nThe health board said this week it would no longer accept referrals for diagnosis unless there is another mental health condition.\nNHS Tayside cited “extensive waiting lists” as the reason for its decision.\nIn a post on its Facebook page, NHS Tayside said: “While a formal assessment and diagnosis can provide a clearer understanding of certain patterns of behaviour, it is important to know that it is not necessary in order to access many forms of support, including additional support within school.\n“We know that navigating concerns about your child’s development can feel overwhelming, and we want to ensure you have the right support and guidance.”\nAndrew Crosbie’s grandson is waiting to be seen by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).\nBut he received a letter two days ago directing him to several other support websites.\nMr Crosbie told STV News he’s been left in the dark about how to support his grandson.\nHe said: “I don’t know if he’s misbehaving or if there is something there. I don’t know how to act with him. I don’t know if I’m giving him into trouble when I shouldn’t be giving him into trouble because it’s not his fault.”\nThe National Autistic Society, which supports hundreds of people in the Dundee and Angus area, has been inundated with calls from parents and carers since the announcement was made.\nCharleen Morton, manager of the charity’s Dundee and Angus branch, said: “It’s beyond comprehension about how they can do this to children.\n“We’ve had a few people very concerned, scared and worried about their own families and children.\n“It’s also the lack of clarity on the (social media) post about what it means for people already on the list. Are they going to be seen?”\nLong waiting lists for CAMHS isn’t unique to NHS Tayside.\nA freedom of information request by the Scottish Conservatives found it’s an issue across the country.\nMore than 400 children and young people have waited longer than three years for a neurodevelopmental assessment in Tayside.\nThe average wait for an ADHD assessment in NHS Highland is 137 weeks, while children in Ayrshire and Arran are waiting more than six years for an autism assessment.\nConservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West Alexander Burnett, convener of the Scottish Parliament’s autism group, criticised the move by NHS Tayside.\nHe said: “CAMHS is the accepted way for parents to seek a diagnosis.\n“It’s the lack of a diagnosis and the lack of the right tools that’s letting parents down.”\nNHS Tayside shared an internal briefing with STV News that states the “criteria” for the neurodevelopmental pathway has been “refined”, meaning children and young people with a co-existing mental health condition will be accepted by CAMHS.\nIt said CAMHS teams have been working with partners in the third sector, education, social work and GPs to change the focus from diagnosis to needs-based support.\nThe new policy does not apply to young people who have already had a letter of acceptance to CAMHS or the neurodevelopmental pathway.\nIt is unclear whether the halt is permanent or temporary.\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said: “We are aware of NHS Tayside’s decision to pause new referrals for a neurodevelopmental assessment to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) for children without a co-existing mental health condition.\n“This decision does not mean there is no support available for children and young people seeking a CAMHS referral in NHS Tayside, or support for their neurodivergence.\n“We’d expect the board to sensitively signpost other appropriate services, including community-based supports, that can be accessed by children and young people when a CAMHS referral is not available.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "A historic Aberdeen staircase once used by thousands of city mill workers could soon be restored to its former glory.\nThe century-old steps, known as Jacob’s Ladder, are currently closed due to safety concerns.\nHowever, local campaigners have renewed their long-running appeal for help to repair the steps.\nJacobs Ladder was opened to the public in 1921 to create a direct route from Don Terrace to Grandholm Bridge, ensuring quick and simple access to Granholm Mill on the other side of the river.\nThe steep steps offer a glimpse into the city’s once-thriving textile heritage when thousands of local workers made their way to and from the woollen mills every day.\nThey were acquired by James and John Crombie, and Grandholm Mill employed more than 3,000 people in 1859 to produce the world-famous cloth bearing their name.\nRosalind Walker is passionate about the ladder and what it means to local people.\nShe said: “It was very important to the war effort. Many of the overcoats worn by British officers were Crombie, and Grandholm became the largest supplier of tweed in the UK. It was a very, very important industry at the time.”\nThe stairs have since fallen into disrepair and have been closed to the public for 15 years due to structural damage.\nHowever, a local community group is renewing efforts to restore them to their former glory.\nGary Dawson from Tillydrone Community Development Trust says the closure means residents of nearby Woodside are forced to walk around Don Terrace onto Gordon Mills Road – via a steep hill with no pavements, uneven cobbles and frequent traffic.\nHe said: “We have widespread support from our host communities of Woodside and Tillydrone but also from further afield.\n“The stairs were the main gateway for workers to attend the various mills along the River Don but now are a gateway to the river and pathways themselves, which offer an escape into beautiful natural spaces on the edge of two areas that continue to host some of the highest areas of deprivation in the country.”\nThe Trust hopes to raise more than £250,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to help restore and reopen the steps.\nGary added: “People are always asking us when are the stairs going to re-open.\n“We have a new village behind us here and people can’t get access to Woodside unless they go up the street at the back, so they would be happy to use the stairs and people coming down would want to use the stairs to access the riverside and sports facilities in the village across the other side.”\nLocals say reopening the stairs will not only provide much-needed access to the river but also preserve the community’s rich heritage.\n“These stairs are so much worth fighting for, they are so important,” explained Rosalind.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "After a turbulent week in Scottish politics, former first minister Nicola Sturgeon took to the stage of the King’s Theatre in Glasgow to make her “comedy debut and comedy finale”.\nSturgeon made her Glasgow International Comedy Festival debut alongside best friend and crime author Val McDermid on Saturday night – just two days after her name was cleared in a police investigation into the SNP’s finances.\nKicking off the event, McDermid told Sturgeon: “You’re free”.\nWhile Sturgeon described the last couple of years – and weeks – as “interesting”.\nThe ex-SNP leader reflected on her resignation from politics, upcoming book and thanked her friends and supporters “from the bottom of her heart”.\n“I just wanted to say, the last few years I wouldn’t have got through without some really good pals – Val and (her wife Jo Sharp) certainly chief amongst them, but also others”, she said.\n“But also without so many of you, people I’ve never met who come along to things like this and send me messages of support.\n“So I just wanted to say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all your support.”\n“You can take the girl out of politics – which hasn’t quite happened yet – but you can’t take the politics out of the girl”, she told the crowd.\n“So when Val showed me what she was planning to say tonight about certain events this week, I had to sort of put my spin doctor hat on.”\nTouching again on politics, Sturgeon later joked that she “might change her mind” about retirement.\nSegueing into a 90-minute conversation about friendship and books, the former first minister sat beside McDermid, looking at ease as she welcomed special guests Ashley Storrie, co-creator and star of Hulu’s series Dinosaur, and Scottish crime writer Christopher Brookmyre to the show throughout.\nAt points, McDermid appeared to go off script, taking swings at Sturgeon’s political opponents, including Conservative MSP Douglas Ross – asking if Storrie’s high-pitched “I’m a wee man” comment was an imitation of him.\nAt another point, McDermid suggested Sturgeon should have “hung on to the Queen” when she died and refused to give her back “until you give [Scotland] another referendum”.\n“I thought we scored this bit of the script,” Sturgeon said, putting her head in her hands.\nMcDermid joked that Sturgeon’s upcoming memoir would have been funnier if she had ghostwritten it.\n“It would have had more jokes,” McDermid said. Sturgeon replied: “Boris Johnson is in it.”\nAs well as touching on current events, the duo discussed why reading matters and revealed the books they love and loathe.\nSTV News Nicola Sturgeon and Val McDermid’s Books and Banter event packed out the 1,785 seat King’s Theatre as part of Saturday night’s Glasgow International Comedy Festival. STV News\nThe pair talked about literature’s special power to “build bridges” and the foundational impact that libraries had on their childhood and their love of reading.\n“We’re here because we love books,” McDermid said.\nAlthough many patrons undoubtedly shared Sturgeon’s love of literature, quite a few likely wanted her to address the news surrounding her career and legacy in recent weeks.\nThey would have left disappointed as the former first minister just about managed to leave politics at the door.\nIn the end, Sturgeon declared it was both her comedy debut and finale.\nThe appearance comes two days after her name was cleared in a police investigation into the SNP’s finances.\nOn Thursday, the former first minister said she’d been “vindicated” and that there was “never a scrap of evidence” against her.\nThe news came after prosecutors gave Police Scotland guidance on what further action should be taken in the probe into the SNP’s finances.\nLast year, the force handed over its findings to the Crown and asked for direction on the next steps of the probe known as Operation Branchform.\nIn the midst of the investigation, Sturgeon’s relationship with husband Peter Murrell broke down as police investigated the finances of Scotland’s governing party.\nThe SNP power couple announced their plans to divorce in January after being estranged for some time.\nOn Thursday, Murrell appeared in court charged with the embezzlement of party funds.\nMurrell made no plea, was committed for further examination and was granted bail.\nSturgeon also recently announced that she would not seek re-election to the Scottish Parliament in 2026.\nThe crowd seemed full of Sturgeon supporters despite her status as one of Scotland’s most divisive political figures.\nSturgeon has been the longest-serving First Minister and the only woman to hold the post.\nAfter leading the country through the Covid pandemic, she became embroiled in the Operation Branchform investigation and she also endured a bitter battle on gender reforms, which many of her opponents claim have tarnished her legacy.\nSome of her critics have likely felt let down over her and the SNP’s failure to achieve Scottish independence. Others have undoubtedly felt annoyed by her continued campaigning for it.\nShe has previously defended her legacy in office. After her retirement announcement, she said she’s been “very open” about the things she’s proud of as well as the “things she could have done better”.\n“I don’t know if it’s possible to be in politics as long as I have without attracting divisive opinions,” she said.\nFollowing the Branchform investigation and her 26-year career in Holyrood, Sturgeon is turning from politics to literature – at least for a bit.\nShe will debut her first book—a memoir that promises to offer an “open, honest and candid” account of the former first minister’s “achievements” and “heartbreaks”—on August 14.\nThe personal journey called ‘Frankly’ will recount the “extraordinary events” that she has lived and led through.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

He later developed a life-threatening case of pneumonia.\nDoctors provided their first in-person update on the pontiff’s condition in a month, in a sign that he has made good progress in his battle against double pneumonia.\nThe Saturday evening briefing is the first since February 21, a week after the 88-year-old was taken to Gemelli. He subsequently experienced several respiratory crises that landed him in critical condition, though he has since stabilised.\nIn another development, the Vatican announced that Francis would appear on Sunday morning to bless the faithful from his 10th floor suite at the hospital.\nHe released an audio message on March 6 and the Vatican distributed a photo of him on March 16, but Sunday’s blessing will be the first live appearance since Francis was admitted for what has become the longest hospital stay of his 12-year papacy.\nThe Argentine pope has chronic lung disease, is prone to respiratory problems in winter and had part of one lung removed as a young man. He was admitted after a bout of bronchitis worsened.\nDoctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and then pneumonia. Blood tests showed signs of anaemia, low blood platelets and the onset of kidney failure, all of which were later resolved after two blood transfusions.\nThe most serious setbacks began on February 28 when Francis experienced an acute coughing fit and inhaled vomit, requiring he use a non-invasive mechanical ventilation mask to help him breathe.\nHe suffered two more respiratory crises in the following days, which required doctors to manually aspirate the mucus, at which point he began sleeping with the ventilation mask at night to help his lungs clear the accumulation of fluids.\nAt no point did he lose consciousness and doctors reported he was alert and co-operative.\nOver the past two weeks, he has stabilised and registered slight improvements, the Vatican press office reported. He no longer needs to wear the ventilation mask at night, and is cutting back his reliance on high flows of supplemental oxygen during the day.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Travel disruption is continuing for air passengers trying to reach Scotland after a major incident closed Heathrow Airport for most of yesterday.\nThe airport is now fully operational, but the knock-on effect is expected to be felt into next week.\nA blaze knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes late on Thursday evening, causing a mass cancellation of flights.\nPassengers at Aberdeen Airport were delighted to be getting on their way but hundreds of passengers are still stranded – scattered all over the world.\nBritish Airways has cancelled 80 flights to and from its London home on Saturday, and many are still stuck abroad waiting for a seat on a new flight to get home.\nHeathrow says it’s expecting an extra 10,000 people to pass through its terminals throughout the day as airlines try to clear a backlog.\nBut with aircraft stuck in the wrong places, crews unable to fly out – and passengers waiting to be brought home – the disruption is not over yet.\nBarrie Wilkins from Edinburgh is stuck in San Diego. He was due to land at Heathrow on Friday.\nHe told STV News: “We were on the runway and had been sitting for half an hour when the pilot came through. He said there had been an incident at London Heathrow, and we’re just waiting for an update.\n“Three and a half hours later, he told us we weren’t going to get the clearance to fly. We had to wait another two hours for British Airways to let us know that they were going to sort us out with hotels.”\nAfter returning to the airport the following day, Barrie was told that the earliest he could get home would be Thursday.\n“After two hours, we were offered various other flight options over five days.\n“Flying into Phoenix, then going to JFK, back to Atlanta to try and get back to Edinburgh – still with no communication from British Airways.\n“We were told that we wouldn’t be compensated for hotels if we booked it ourselves and any bookings had to be booked through British Airways. We still haven’t been told whether or not we’ll be compensated.\n“I appreciate the magnitude of the situation but the biggest failing here for the airline is to just go completely cold on their customers. You would expect a little bit more from an airline like British Airways.”\nA spokesperson for the airport said: “We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today.\n“Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday’s outage at an off-airport power substation.\n“We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.\n“Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight.”\nTransport secretary Heidi Alexander said: “This incident caused significant disruption, but Heathrow, National Grid, and our emergency services have worked swiftly to get people travelling again.\n“Heathrow is a massive airport that uses the energy of a small city, so it’s imperative we identify how this power failure happened and learn from this to ensure a vital piece of national infrastructure remains strong.\n“Whilst Heathrow is back to business, some disruption is expected over coming days as things get back to normal so I encourage anyone travelling to check with their airlines and plan their journeys.”\nHeathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9 million passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024, and around 200,000 passengers have been affected by Friday’s closure.\nThis is believed to be the worst disruption at Heathrow since December 2010, when thousands of Christmas getaway passengers camped in the terminals because of widespread cancellations caused by snow.\nIn April of that year, air travel was grounded across Europe because of an ash cloud caused by an Icelandic volcanic eruption.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Steve Clarke believes Scotland are reaping the benefits from being “put through the mill” by a string of high-calibre opponents as they bid to secure their place in the top tier of the Nations League at home to Greece on Sunday.\nThe Scots endured a demoralising run of just one win in 16 matches between September 2023 and November 2024.\nThat period included friendlies against England, France and Netherlands, each of their three Euro 2024 group-stage matches, and then Nations League Group A1 fixtures against Poland, Croatia and Portugal.\nHaving won each of their last three matches at home to Croatia, away to Poland and away to Greece in the Nations League play-off first leg on Thursday, Clarke feels the gruelling run of fixtures his team has faced over the past 18 months is now bearing fruit.\n“We’ve been to France, we’ve played England, we’ve played Holland,” said the Scotland boss.\n“I put them through the mill with those games but eventually you get the experience.\n“So when we went to Greece the other night, we knew what to expect and the players were able to handle that.”\nScotland are currently 45th in the rankings, but Clarke is adamant they are now a better team and more equipped to deal with top-tier nations as a result of the fixtures they have faced.\n“We have improved,” he said. “If you look at the world rankings, it will tell you different. That’s a little anomaly that seems to have popped up with the Nations League.\n“But as a team we have improved and the players have improved at this level too. We understand what it takes to win a game at this level. Thankfully, recently we have been able to show we can do that.”\nBournemouth midfielder Ryan Christie will be available for Sunday’s second leg at Hampden after being suspended for the first leg in Piraeus.\n“I’ve seen Ryan a couple of times for Bournemouth and people will tell you that he is playing a slightly deeper role but when you watch Bournemouth play, he is still the one who is leading the high press and is the one that gets after the game and gets forward to the edge of the box,” said Clarke, who has generally used Christie in an attacking role.\n“All they have done at Bournemouth is given him a nominal position, if you like, but he plays the same way Ryan plays. It does not matter where you play Ryan on the pitch, he brings energy and quality and that is what he always brings for us as well.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Scotland talisman Scott McTominay hopes the journey he is on with club and country still has a long way to go yet as he outlined his intention to keep playing at the highest level deep into his 30s.\nThe 28-year-old midfielder is poised to win his 60th cap in Sunday’s Nations League play-off against Greece, while he has become a key man in Napoli’s Serie A title pursuit since leaving boyhood club Manchester United last summer.\nAs he reflected on what appears to have been a smooth transition from Old Trafford – where he spent two decades – to life in Naples, McTominay detailed the inner desire to get the best out of himself that is allowing him to continue flourishing at the sharp end of European football.\n“Both incredible football clubs,” he said of United and Napoli. “I’m very grateful for the journey that I’ve had, but I still have many more years in my career where I want to carry on improving and just making the most out of my career.\n“I never want to look back whenever I retire and think that I could have given more or I could have optimised my career and had more time on the pitch than I did. That’s just a goal to improve at all costs and obviously help Steve Clarke and all the (Scotland) players while I’m here.\n“For me, it’s just important to make sure that I’m always available for both club and country. It’s so important to me looking after myself and my body to have as long a career as I possibly can. I want to go really far into my 30s if it’s possible. That’s something I’ve always had a goal of doing.\n“No matter what happens, I just want to make sure that I’m playing well and prepared to give my all for both club and country.”\nMcTominay, whose penalty in Piraeus on Thursday gave Scotland a 1-0 first-leg over Greece to protect, has become a darling of the Tartan Army, scoring 12 goals in 59 appearances and featuring at two European Championships, since his debut in 2018.\n“There’s been so many,” he said when asked for a favourite moment in dark blue. “There’s been Kenny McLean’s goal away in Norway (in June 2023), which was amazing.\n“My two goals at home against Spain spring to mind and obviously getting to the major tournaments. I’m just hungry for more and for this group, I feel like we can restart and kick on forward again.”\nScotland have won each of their last three matches – against Croatia, Poland and Greece – to banish the negativity that met their Euro 2024 group-stage exit. McTominay felt the backlash last summer was “a bit unjustified”.\n“First of all, in the summer it was very fine margins,” said the midfielder. “The media will always say it is doom and gloom, stuff like that.\n“I don’t really read the criticism or pay too much attention to it but from the general feeling from some friends, family members, other players, I feel like sometimes it’s a bit unjustified from how well Steve Clarke has done in terms of what he’s done for this whole group of players.\n“He’s basically transformed us into believing that we can go and play against Spain, Germany and teams like that. He’s such a great manager and a person as well, and it helps you progress as a Scotland player.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Three men have been convicted of a hit-and-run murder bid in Paisley.\nThe victim was mowed down by a silver Toyota Yaris as he crossed the street in Springbank Road on April 21, 2022.\nThe then 37-year-old was targeted following an earlier dispute.\nStuart Lindsay, 31, David Sherry, 36, and Daniel Millan, 27, have now been convicted of attempted murder at the High Court in Glasgow.\nProsecutors said the trio and two others had all acted together as part of a “coordinated plan to inflict violence” on the victim that evening.\nThe three were remanded in custody and will be sentenced in May.\nJurors heard how the Yaris and an Audi driven by Lindsay had gone to Paisley in convoy.\nThe victim was said to have been effectively lured to the scene.\nHe was seen speaking to the driver of the Audi moments before the attack.\nIt was then the Yaris “came out of nowhere” and ploughed into the man as he crossed the road.\nIn his closing speech, prosecutor Michael Macintosh told jurors: “[The victim] was sent up into the air. The Audi drove off so quickly that (a witness) thought it was that car which hit him.\n“The Audi had driven off before [the victim] had even hit the ground, but it was the Yaris that struck him.”\nThe Yaris was then wiped and torched at Airlink Industrial Estate in Paisley.\nSherry had been clocked getting out of the car before it was set on fire, clutching a weapon.\nThe five-strong gang all then fled from the area in the Audi.\nLindsay was a friend of another of the mob, John Wallace, who has since died.\nHe claimed Wallace had got him involved under “false pretences”.\nMr Macintosh suggested that if Lindsay had no idea what was to happen that day, he may, at least, have stopped to check on the victim or called for help.\nThe advocate depute: “Instead, [the victim] had not even touched the ground and Mr Lindsay had sped off.”\nSherry admitted to being a passenger in the Yaris but claimed he was only aware of the collision when it actually happened.\nMr Macintosh put to the jury that Sherry would have them believe he had been “in a panic, desperate to get out the situation that he was in”.\nThe victim was left badly hurt but survived.\nLindsay and Sherry were found guilty of the charge after a trial. Millan had earlier pleaded guilty before the case began.\nLord Mulholland told the three: “You have been convicted of a horrific attempted murder – a car driven at someone to try and kill him all because of a drug deal gone wrong.\n“Be under no illusion, it will be a lengthy sentence for all of you.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

Some of the workshops on offer include baking, farming and woodwork.\nThe charity hopes they can now find the means to continue providing support before changes come into effect next month.\nA spokesperson for Aberdeen City Health and Social Care said: “Detailed reviews have shown that some recipients of services at Newton Dee do not meet our eligibility criteria.\n“Those criteria, which are applied across all ACHSCP care packages, ensure that services are funded for those with high, critical and emergency needs.\n“As part of our continuous review of individual needs, there are some changes to the services that individuals will be entitled to. This has been done in collaboration with the client and the provider.\n“Our reassessment of clients’ needs also showed that some service-users have sufficient monies to self-fund the activities they enjoy.\n“We are now working on detailed transition plans for those people whose service will be changed, as of April 1.\n“We have engaged with Newton Dee for well over a year in an effort to negotiate an equitable solution and hope that they understand that we are duty-bound to make the best possible use of public money.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

PA Media\nHis doctor told him that “we’re going to treat this and we’re going to cure this”, and Brian said he will have a prostatectomy, which removes part or all of the prostate gland.\n“I’m devastated, but I believe I’m hoping that we can do it,” he added.\nWhen asked by the newspaper about it being difficult to tell his siblings, the news after it was confirmed days following Linda’s funeral, Brian said they have “been through enough” so he told them individually of his condition.\n“I’m focusing on the hope, they can treat it, and they can cure it,” he added.\n“The way my sisters handled their cancers, I hope to God that I can have the courage that they had.”\nLinda was first diagnosed in 2005 and given the all-clear in 2011, but in 2017 was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer.\nIn 2020, it spread, and by 2023, it was in her brain.\nAnne, who Linda joined on the TV series The Nolans Go Cruising, was diagnosd with breast cancer for the second time in 2020 and previously said she is now cancer-free.\nLoose Women star Coleen was diagnosed with skin cancer last year and said she was using a chemotherapy cream to remove it.\nTheir sister Bernie died of breast cancer in 2013, aged 52.\nBrian said that he was referred to a genetic department in Manchester, and it was “amazing how many people had actually had cancer as some part of the reason they died” in his family.\nHe said the doctors are “even thinking that there may be a genetic mutation or something between the four cancers that our families” have, which includes breast, prostate, liver and pancreatic cancers.\nBrian said his father “died of systemic cirrhosis (liver damage) but he also had liver cancer, my uncle died of pancreatic cancer”.\nHe also said he wants to raise awareness of prostate cancer as his friends did not know anything about the illness.\n“We should know more about this, and I’m going to definitely push for a campaign to to send guys a letter once a year, like we do for women and bowel cancer,” Brian said.\nOther famous faces such as comedian Sir Stephen Fry, the late broadcaster Bill Turnbull – and more recently Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, who revealed his prostate cancer was terminal in 2024, have been outspoken about the condition.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Edinburgh Council has been accused of “raiding the pockets of residents” after putting out a £320,000 contract for “glitzy” graphic design services to work with its tourism marketing services.\nA council tender for suppliers said it was looking for graphic design firms to “create promotional assets and aid with campaign and brand roll-out and delivery” for Forever Edinburgh, which markets the city to potential visitors and residents.\nThe cost is an estimate, and if the council proceeds with the project, the final sum could be lower or higher than £320,000.\nCouncillors and campaigners have criticised the amount being spent on branding at a time when the city is raising council tax and looking at cuts to essential services.\nGreen councillor Ben Parker said: “Greens have consistently argued for the need to shift the tourist offer in the city towards a more sustainable model.\n“It’s hard to reconcile this idea with hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money being spent on further marketing the city as a tourist destination.\n“During discussions about spending from the forthcoming tourist tax, we were the sole voice in advocating not to spend funds on advertising, instead suggesting that money raised should be spent on local infrastructure and services, including much-needed social housing.\n“Rest assured that Green councillors will continue to scrutinise all spending within the Council and ensuring it represents good value for money for residents across the city.”\nAnd Benjamin Elks, grassroots development manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Taxpayers in Edinburgh will be outraged to see the council splurging cash on glitzy marketing campaigns.\n“With household budgets already squeezed, local representatives are raiding the pockets of residents while cutting back core services.\n“Edinburgh city councillors need to get their priorities straight and ensure they deliver value for money for taxpayers.”\nThe cost would be spread over four years, with the winning graphic design firm or firms being placed on a two year contract with the possibility of two one year extensions after that.\nApplications are limited to firms bringing in or committed to bringing in over £53,000 per year.\nFirms applying will also provide examples of prior work, with the tender asking that it should be previous tourism or destination marketing work if possible.\nSubmissions will close on April 8, after which the council will consider the applications submitted.\nHousing, Homelessness and Fair Work Convener, Labour councillor Lezley Marion Cameron said: “As Scotland’s capital city it’s right that we promote Edinburgh to the world and Forever Edinburgh is an integral part of our city’s marketing strategy.\n“Its website promotes events, activities, venues, attractions, businesses, seasonal features and travel information to Edinburgh residents, visitors, and businesses alike.\n“Edinburgh and Lothian residents are also able to access exclusive offers, including high-value monthly rewards and special resident prices at various attractions via the Residents Rewards feature of Forever Edinburgh, enabling residents to enjoy more of Edinburgh at a lesser expense to them.\n“It is also important to note that this procurement notice is at an initial stage and is intended to cover a wide framework of creative support.”\nMore information on the tender can be found on the Public Contracts Scotland website here.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "TV presenter Davina McCall said the removal of a benign brain tumour was “the hardest thing I’ve ever been through” while reflecting on the experience during Red Nose Day.\nThe 57-year-old underwent surgery last year to remove a benign tumour, known as a colloid cyst, which was found after she was offered a health check-up as part of her menopause advocacy work.\nMcCall was among a host of presenters for Red Nose Day on Friday, with the event raising £34,022,590 for the charity Comic Relief.\nHosted at Salford’s MediaCity, the event saw sketches from some of the biggest shows on the BBC, including Strictly Come Dancing, Gladiators and Beyond Paradise.\nSpeaking on the show, McCall said: “I had a pretty mad year this year. Doctors found a benign brain tumour, by chance, and after a lot of deliberating, I had it removed.\n“And it’s been, quite possibly, the hardest thing I’ve ever been through and this whole experience, weirdly, kind of weighing up all the risks and all the positive things about having this tumour removed made me think deeply about what life is all about, and what really, really matters when things get tough.”\nMcCall then began to cry as she spoke of the support she had received from her family and partner Michael Douglas.\nShe is known for hosting Big Brother between 2000 and 2010 during its Channel 4 run, has long advocated on women’s health issues, and has presented documentaries on contraception and menopause.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Lando Norris admitted he is “paying the price for not doing a good enough job” after McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri raised the championship stakes by taking pole position for the Chinese Grand Prix.\nNorris arrived for the second round of the season in Shanghai leading the title race for the first time in his life.\nBut after he made two mistakes in qualifying for Saturday’s sprint event – and then ran off the road on the first lap of the dash to the chequered flag to finish only eighth – he will start third for Sunday’s main event.\nPiastri landed the first pole of his career as Mercedes’ George Russell split the two McLaren drivers to take second.\nMax Verstappen will line up from fourth, one place ahead of Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton.\nNorris laid down a title marker with a statement win in Melbourne a week ago, but the 25-year-old said here: “I am not as comfortable as I was in Australia. It is just too many mistakes and I have not done the best job. And Oscar has.\n“Our car is the quickest one but it is still tricky to drive and putting a lap together is hard to do on a consistent basis. I have a long night ahead of me to look at the data and see where I can improve tomorrow.\n“I have not done a perfect job, the field is tight, and I am paying the price for not doing a good enough job.”\nNorris has been talked up as the early title favourite following his season-opening win in Melbourne. McLaren also hold an advantage over the rest of the field.\nIndeed Russell claimed earlier this week that the British team should win every race this season with a car he believes is superior to the Red Bull which won all but one in 2023.\nIn qualifying, Norris trailed Piastri by 0.090 sec heading into the final runs. But as Piastri then extended his advantage, Norris aborted his second lap, ending the session a tenth and a half adrift of his team-mate.\nTo make matters worse for Norris, he was usurped by Russell in the closing moments.\n“It is a big surprise,” said Russell, who finished just 0.082 sec behind Piastri.",

      "content_en": "Flights have begun landing at Heathrow as it aims to return to normal operation on Saturday after the airport was shut over a loss of power, with restrictions on overnight flights temporarily lifted.\nFlights resumed at the west London airport on Friday evening following hours of closure after a blaze knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes late on Thursday evening.\nA statement on Saturday morning read: “We can confirm that Heathrow is open and fully operational today. Teams across the airport continue to do everything they can to support passengers impacted by yesterday’s outage at an off-airport power substation.\n“We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today’s schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through the airport.\n“Passengers travelling today should check with their airline for the latest information regarding their flight.”\nThe Metropolitan Police are not treating the incident as suspicious and the London Fire Brigade’s investigation is focusing on the electrical distribution equipment.\nAccording to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, British Airways (BA) flight BA56 from Johannesburg, South Africa was the first regular passenger flight to land at Heathrow since Thursday evening, touching down at 4.37am.\nBA, which has a major presence at Heathrow, said it expects to operate around 85% of its scheduled flights at the airport on Saturday.\nThe North Hyde electrical substation caught fire, causing Heathrow to close for the day. / Credit: PA\nThe airline would usually expect to run nearly 600 departures and arrivals on Saturday but it is understood cancellations will be made, where possible, to high-frequency routes.\nA spokesperson said: “We are planning to operate as many flights as possible to and from Heathrow on Saturday, but to recover an operation of our size after such a significant incident is extremely complex.\n“We expect around 85% of our Saturday Heathrow schedule to run, but it is likely that all travelling customers will experience delays as we continue to navigate the challenges posed by Friday’s power outage at the airport.”\nRestrictions on overnight flights were temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, the Department of Transport said.\nRestrictions on overnight flights were temporarily lifted to help ease congestion, the Department of Transport said.\nAccording to Heathrow’s website, there is no formal ban on night flights but since the 1960s, the Government has placed restrictions on them.\nThere is an annual limit of 5,800 night-time take-offs and landings between the hours of 11.30pm and 6am as well as a nightly limit, which caps the amount of noise the airport can make at night.\nHow the chaos unfolded\nHeathrow Airport shut down completely early on Friday after a fire at the North Hyde electrical substation, which contained 25,000 litres of cooling oil, left it without power.\nMore than 200,000 passengers had their flights cancelled or diverted. Thousands of homes in the area lost power, and over 100 people were evacuated.\nHeathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye called it an “unprecedented” day of disruption. “It’s not a small fire,” he said.\n“We have lost power equal to that of a mid-sized city. Our backup systems have worked as they should, but they are not designed to run the entire airport.”\nPower was later restored after the National Grid implemented an “interim solution,” allowing some flights to depart from Heathrow on Friday evening.\nThe London Fire Brigade has said the fire at the electricity substation that caused Heathrow Airport’s closure on Friday is “believed to be non-suspicious”.\nCommander Simon Messinger, who is leading the Met Police response to the incident, said on Friday evening: “The investigation into the cause of the fire remains in its early stages. After initial assessment, we are not treating this incident as suspicious, although inquiries do remain ongoing.\n“Due to the location of the substation and the impact this incident has had on critical national infrastructure, the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command are leading our inquiries into this matter.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

And that makes me personally quite sad.”\nHowever, while council funding will end at the start of April, it’s hoped the asset transfer could be in operation by the summer.\nGerry said: “My ideal scenario is that the Trust is in place, the golf course is blooming, people are using it every day of the week, and we get visitors from all over Scotland.\n“There’s somewhere for them to eat, somewhere to have a drink. And we could maybe even go back down the route of a having a professional back in the golf course.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

That means a draw or better in the second leg will guarantee a League A place for their next appearance in the competition.\nThe win follows victories over Poland and Croatia at the end of last year and means Scotland are building a head of steam at an important time.\n“It’s what the gaffer has always said, that momentum [is important],” Adams said. “Keeping in the game and staying in the game, having something to take back to Hampden is good for us and we can build off that now.\n“It’s positive, it gives us something to build on now going back to Hampden.”\nScotland showed attacking intent and defensive resilience as they pushed for their goal before weathering a storm from a determined home side.\n“It’s a bit frustrating how we didn’t impose ourselves in the second half but we dug in and we got the result in the end,” Adams admitted.\n“We had a few chances. I had two chances that I probably should have scored and made it a bigger gap.\n“We dug in towards the end, got the win, and that’s all that matters.\n“The second half we defended so well but the first half we attacked so well and it kind of balanced out.”\nThe striker has no doubts about the rewards on offer for completing the job, saying the prize of staying in the top tier of the competition is an important one.\n“It’s a challenge, obviously, coming up against better teams, better players but it tests us all the time,” he said.\n“We lost a few games in the league so that’s something we can build on and look to improve next time.\n“We’re getting better and better every campaign so hopefully we’ll finish this off strongly and stay in League A.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",
