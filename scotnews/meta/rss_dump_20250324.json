Matilda Jr was due to be performed at the SEC in Glasgow from Tuesday until Saturday, using two different groups of children. However, performing arts academy GAMTA only had rights for the show in venues with a capacity under 400 - but the SEC's Lomond Suite seats 497. The rights holders - understood to be Music Theatre International Europe - then revoked the licence, meaning a group of young performers suddenly learned their three weekend shows were scrapped.\nOne group of children handled shows from Tuesday to Thursday, with the second cast to start their run on Friday. The disappointment, first reported by Glasgow Live, prompted parents to post on social media that it resulted in tears from young cast members. Caroline Hendoe's daughter Scarlett, 12, was one of the second group of students who only performed once in the show, which is a slimmed down one hour adaptation of the successful stage musical, based on Roald Dahl's book. She told BBC Scotland News she felt the rights holders should have made an exception for the sake of the children. Carloline said: \"While they may be technically right, the emotional cost of their decision is immeasurable. \"These young performers have spent months rehearsing, pouring their hearts into this production, only to have their dreams shattered. \"The right thing to do would have been to find a resolution that didn't punish the children for an administrative mistake - the kids deserved better.\" Ms Hendoe added that her daughter was taking part with GAMTA for the first time and had spent three months rehearsing and preparing for the show.\n'Deeply sorry'",

Argyll and Bute Council decided earlier this month to build a new £43m campus close to the current high school in Tobermory. Many parents wanted a more central location so that pupils in the south of the island would no longer have to travel by ferry to Oban for schooling and stay in hostels during the week. The online petition, which has received nearly 700 signatures, suggests the decision ignores children's rights to a family life. The council has been approached for comment.\nThe location of the island's only high school has long been a source of division on Mull. Pupils living in the north go to the school in Tobermory, but the commute is more than 90 minutes for those living in the south, and most travel to Oban on the mainland, staying in hostels during the week. Campaigners had argued for a new secondary school to be built in a more central location such as Craignure, while keeping a primary school in Tobermory. But the council said splitting the campus would cost the authority an extra £12m, and that any further delay could jeopardise promised Scottish government funding.\nRob Claxton-Ingham, who started the petition believes some of the information presented to councillors who took the decision was misleading. He said: \"There would be shared costs - the development could share the costs of developing infrastructure rather than charging Argyll and Bute.\"\nChermaine Laurie is among parents on the island who fear they may have to move to avoid being separated from their children",

But why was it needed?\nThere were more boos at full-time but a fair number of supporters had vanished by then. It would be too dramatic to say their optimism of making the World Cup also disappeared, but the fact is Greece are in Scotland's group and they have now done a proper psychological number on Scotland before those games in the autumn. Clarke said as much in the aftermath.\nHe has some months to ponder things now, a window in which to consider his next move. He suggested he regretted not changing his team a little more from Thursday to Sunday. He spoke about freshness, or lack of it. \"I'll go away and look at myself,\" he said.\nWhat might he be thinking about? The safe return of Ben Doak to add width and pace, for sure. The desperately needed reintroduction of Aaron Hickey after his awful injury woes, without question.\nClarke is deeply loyal to the players who have delivered for him, but Scott McKenna is playing in La Liga every week. The composition of his midfield, too. Kenny McLean has been a tremendous servant but the time has surely come for Ferguson to take over.\nRelegation to League B is, in itself, no great disaster. Scotland will win more games down there. They'll have a better chance of grabbing a play-off place in the next Euros while operating in less rarefied air.\nThe thing that made Sunday stunning was the complete disintegration of a team we thought had more about them. That was the takeaway. Clarke has been here before, but the hope was he would never be back here again.",

The mother-of-two from Peterhead gave birth to her daughter Ivy in May 2020, right in the midst of the Covid lockdown and was isolated for many of the weeks leading up to and after giving birth. Her son Luca was born in 2023 in much more normal circumstances. Five years on from the beginning of lockdown, Stacie told BBC Scotland News her second baby helped her get over the trauma of giving birth during a pandemic.\nHospital maternity wards were placed under strict regulations in March 2020. Expectant mothers had to wear face masks and no visitors were allowed. It was not known how the virus could affect pregnant women. Stacie describes the arrivals of Ivy and Luca as \"day and night.\" She said: \"They were similar in the sense that they were both sections, they were both on the larger side but that's pretty much the only similarities between them.\"\nStacie Buchan Stacie's partner Fraser was allowed to stay during her second birth\nStacie's partner Fraser wasn't allowed to be in the hospital ward for her first labour. That meant she had to make decisions and face procedures such as being induced alone - at a time when she felt \"very vulnerable\". Fraser was able to be with her in the operating theatre and then in the recovery room for an hour or two, before being told he had to leave. Stacie spent her first five days of motherhood alone, apart from the midwives working in the hospital. \"I still to this day think that whole experience of having Ivy in lockdown contributed somewhat to my postpartum depression,\" she said. \"I can't say for definite but I do think it had a lasting impact on me emotionally,\" she said.\nFear of giving birth alone\nIt wasn't until she became pregnant again in 2023, that Stacie realised the long-term influence the first experience had on her. \"There was a fear that stemmed from Ivy's pregnancy that I thought was put to bed, but it wasn't until I was pregnant again with Luca that I realised it hadn't.\" Stacie said even though she knew the pandemic was over, she spent most of her second pregnancy worried about having to give birth alone. She ended up having to be signed off from work early. But when the time came to give birth it was a completely different experience. This time, Fraser was allowed to stay in the ward for the duration and when they got home the family were able to welcome visitors to meet baby Luca.\nStacie Buchan Ivy is now four, and her little brother Luca is one.",

The former sheriff court and prison is being redeveloped as a visitor attraction at a cost of about £30m, and is due to open later this year. High Life Highland (HLH), which will operate the site, has released the ticket prices which range from the cheapest - £14 for a child - to up to £65 for a family of two adults and three children. HLH said deals would be available to Highland residents.\nThe redevelopment has received funding from the £315m Inverness and Highland City Region Deal. Called the Inverness Castle Experience, it will have an interactive \"journey\" taking visitors through the history of the Highlands.\nHow much will tickets cost?\nHLH said tickets would be cheaper if booked online in advance. The costs include: Adult - £20 (online)/£22\nSeniors - £18/£20\nChild - £14/£16\nFamily (two adults and two children) - £46/£54\nFamily (two adults and three children) £55/£65 HLH said Highland residents who pay for its High Life Highland card would have access to more booking options, and 10% discount on food and drinks after purchasing full-price tickets.\nIan Brown, a councillor and co-chairman of Inverness Castle Delivery Group, has welcomed ticket deals for Highland residents. He added: \"The Inverness Castle Experience is set to become a key landmark in the region and ensuring that our Highland communities can enjoy it throughout the year is a great move. \"This initiative encourages local engagement and fosters pride in our heritage and Highland stories.\" The Scottish Courts and Tribunal Service moved out of the castle in 2020, and Highland Council has been leading the revamp. Last month, public agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) put an extra £863,000 towards the project.\nWhat is the castle's history?\nGetty Images An etching of the castle and Inverness' riverside from the mid-19th Century\nThe sandstone Inverness Castle was built in 1836 to plans drawn by architect William Burn. It was constructed on a mound overlooking the city and the River Ness. In 1848, a building known as the North Block was added and served as a prison. But a castle had occupied the site from possibly as far back as the 11th Century. Over the centuries, the fortification fell under the control of the forces of Edward I, Robert the Bruce and James I, II and IV. In 1562, it was attacked and damaged by soldiers loyal to Mary, Queen of Scots, before it was almost destroyed by Royalist troops in the 1600s. Bonnie Prince Charlie's forces blew the castle up in 1746 to prevent it from falling into the hands of government troops. It was said that a French sergeant, who had brought his poodle with him to Scotland, set off the explosives. The soldier was caught in the blast, and his body was blown across to the opposite side of the River Ness. His dog survived.",

The 26-storey towers at Wyndford Road were destroyed using using controlled explosions to make way for nearly 400 new homes. An exclusion zone and temporary evacuation centre were set up as residents from 240 nearby properties were asked to leave during the operation. A fourth high-rise block will also be taken down as part of the redevelopment using a piece-by-piece demolition technique.\nThe Wyndford estate was built in the Maryhill area of the city, on the site of the old Glasgow City barracks, with the high storey blocks completed in the late 1960s. The four 26-storey blocks and several smaller high-rise buildings at one point provided homes for around 6,000 people.\nGetty Images Getty Images Crowds had gathered to watch the explosions take place Crowds had gathered to watch the explosions take place\nSome residents had campaigned against the demolition plan, arguing instead for a retrofit option. But owners Wheatley Homes housing association claimed the flats were not fit for purpose and could not feasibly be altered to meet modern floor space standards. The 600 flats in the high-rise blocks will be replaced by 386 affordable homes. The masterplan for the redevelopment includes a community hub with a hall, café, meeting rooms and computer access.\nTrisha Rankin delivered papers in the flats as a teenager.\nLocals gathered near the estate to watch the demolition, with some saying it brought back memories for them. Trisha Rankin used to carry out a paper round in the towers as a teenager and seeing the buildings torn down was \"very emotional\". She told BBC Scotland News: \"I'd start at the top and work my way down with my big bag of papers. Not every person would get them delivered but there were a lot – I'd get a lift up, start at the back of six and I'd be a few hours going up and down the stairs. \"Those flats were really good, there was a lot of lovely families in there and a lot of pensioners. Through the years they've moved on and the flats started deteriorating - it was time to bring them down.\" Ms Rankin added that the work was a \"big change\" for the entire area, Alasdair MacMahon stayed in the flats during the 1980s, and still lives locally. He said: \"There was a good community spirit there but I feel the flats have served their purpose.\"\nGetty Images The Wyndford estate was built on the site of Maryhill barracks in the 1960s\nResidents were asked to leave their homes on Sunday morning and were offered breakfast and lunch at a nearby secondary school which was used as an evacuation centre. People living within the exclusion zone were offered Tesco gift vouchers, worth £100, as compensation for the disruption. St Gregory's Catholic Church, located nearby on Kelvindale Road, had its stained glass windows covered with protective sheeting. Misting systems were being used to minimise dust after the demolition but residents had been advised to shut windows, keep pets indoors and cover fish ponds and rabbit hutches. People with respiratory conditions were also advised to avoid the area. Clean-up teams carried out street sweeping and jet washing after the explosions.\nWheatley Homes The redevelopment will see new 386 new rental homes constructed",

In his hometown of Dumfries, however, he is involved in a smaller venture as an owner of a little pub which is helping the local music scene to thrive. He is part of a group called To The Nines which bought the Coach and Horses on the Whitesands a couple of years ago. It has been praised by bands, music organisations and people working to revive the town centre for the boost it is giving to the south of Scotland town where the global superstar grew up.\nThe Coach and Horses on the Whitesands in Dumfries has bands playing most weekends\nHarris - whose real name is Adam Wiles - has previously shown a commitment to the area where he was raised when he offered to help out workers affected by the closure of a fish factory in Annan. He is listed under his real name as a director of To The Nines Ltd, along with his friend Mark Irving. A report in The Sun recently highlighted how he had gone back to his home town to make his investment. Title deeds show the group bought the Coach and Horses in August 2023 for £190,000 and it has continued to build on its reputation as a local music venue. The pub is one of a growing number of venues in Dumfries helping give a platform to local bands.\nHagen Patterson, director of the Dumfries Music Collective (DMC) which aims to provide musical opportunities to young people in the region, said they had always recognised the Coach and Horses as an \"iconic grassroots music venue\". \"We have witnessed some great artistry to come out of the pub over many years,\" he said. He said it could offer a \"leg up\" to local artists and it was great that such a worldwide star had helped allow it to do so. \"Performing live for the first time, even if just for a handful of listeners, provides invaluable experience,\" he said. \"It's a chance to try out brand new material, gauge reactions, and build a local fan base. \"We are delighted that Calvin and Mark have ensured the longevity of the Coach and Horses, this helps foster our scene.\"\nKissing the Flint Kissing the Flint performed at the Coach and Horses earlier this month\nKissing The Flint recently played at the pub having started gigging in Dumfries a few years ago having moved from Australia. The band's Leah Chynoweth-Tidy said the site had quickly won their hearts. \"All the staff are so supportive and welcoming, really love their live music and are super proud of their historic, vibrant wee venue, which well they should be,\" she said. \"It's always a fantastic experience playing there as the audience are open to any kind of genre and are incredibly responsive and enthusiastic about our original music, which is becoming a rarer thing these days in many venues. \"The Coach feels like coming home for us every time we play there, and all who sail in her have become part of our music family.\"\nSandy Robertson Andy McMillan said the pub owned by Calvin Harris was an \"awesome grass roots venue\"\nAndy McMillan, frontman with Dumfries three-piece the Dogz, has similar praise. \"The Coach is an awesome grassroots venue,\" he said. \"All the staff are passionate about live music and supporting local bands, whether established acts or those just cutting their teeth in front of an audience. \"It's always a top gig for us and although it's a small venue its contribution to the local music scene is huge.\"\nGetty Images Harris plays huge venues now but started out with much smaller gigs\nJust along the road from the pub, Rab Smith runs the record shop Domino Entertainment and is a former chairman of the town's retailers' association. He said he believed the area could be at the heart of boosting nightlife in Dumfries. \"The whole Whitesands could be a great entertainment centre,\" he said. \"The old tourist board building could be spectacular.\" He also said it was good to see a local boy made good like Harris putting something back into the community. \"It is a great wee pub - it is too small to be a King Tut's - but it is great that somebody is putting money into it and keeping it alive,\" he added.\nRichie Nicoll Richie Nicoll chairs Dumfries Town Board looking at ways of regenerating the town centre",

      "content_en": "40 years of Deacon Blue - and you can get our new album on cassette\n2 days ago Share Save Catherine Lyst BBC Scotland News Share Save\nBBC Deacon Blue formed in Glasgow in the 1980s\nIn 1985 Deacon Blue formed in Glasgow and over the years have achieved great success with 12 UK top 40 singles and two UK number 1 albums. Their debut album, Raintown, referring to Glasgow, spawned what is probably their most popular hit, Dignity, which is still regularly played at parties and has even been adopted by Dundee United fans. Forty years on, the band are still together - after a brief hiatus - and are releasing a new album, The Great Western Road. The album title gives a nod to the places they used to meet up for gigs back in the day and also serves as a metaphor for their lives. \"I was thinking about these big roads and avenues that lead out of Glasgow and at the time of life we're at it's this unknown ending,\" singer Ricky Ross tells BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. \"You have to think about these things so it became an interesting metaphor - the idea that you just don't know what's round the corner. It's also quite exciting.\"\nGetty Images The band began when Ross got together with drummer Dougie Vipond\nRoss, a former teacher, points out that a lot has changed in 40 years, not least the music industry, which has changed almost beyond recognition. To celebrate this, and to mark their milestone, the band are releasing a cassette version of the new album. \"That's causing people quite a lot of amusement as they can't find a cassette player,\" Ross says. The band formed in the summer of 1985 - when Ross moved from Dundee to Glasgow - taking their name from the 1977 Steely Dan song Deacon Blues. Original members included Ross, singer Lorraine McIntosh - who married Ross in 1990 - drummer Dougie Vipond, keyboard player James Prime and guitarist Graeme Kelling. \"This all started when Dougie and I got together,\" Ross adds. \"Over the last 40 years our lives have changed and things have gone in different directions for everyone but those of us who started it are very, very close. \"They are the closest people in my life. We all created something very special when we started.\"\nGetty Images The band are incorporating smaller theatre shows into their current tour\nRoss says he really appreciates the older fans who still come to the gigs but is also pleased to see younger fans in their audiences. \"I am very grateful that people are still coming – that they've come all these years to see us,\" he says. \"They are the core audience but its lovely that they've passed this on to other people as well. \"We were playing at the Albert Hall a couple of years ago – there were four guys in their early 20s and I thought 'are they taking the mickey here?' but they were for real and that was quite nice.\" The band are currently playing a string of gigs around the UK and Ireland, some of which are in smaller theatres. \"We wanted to do the new record and a lot of the songs we haven't got the chance to do when we play bigger shows,\" Ross says. \"But we're coming back later in the year – playing in Aberdeen and a couple of shows at the Hydro in Glasgow - when we'll do everything, all manner of things, which we always try to do. \"You always want to make people feel that they've got the best of you.\"",

      "content_en": "Peter Mullan's return to the stage is a one-off: 'I can't afford it'\n3 days ago Share Save Pauline McLean BBC Scotland Arts Correspondent Share Save\nGetty Images Peter Mullan has tended to avoid theatre due to the low wages\nWhen Peter Mullan steps on stage as legendary football manager Bill Shankly on Friday night, it will be for the first time in more than 30 years. Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success. There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan. \"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says. \"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.\nPA Media There is a statue to legendary football manager Bill Shankly outside Anfield\n\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\" Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus. The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book. The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced. \"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"\nPA Media Scottish football manager Bill Shankly was credited with transforming Liverpool FC into one of Europe's leading clubs.\nThe wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice. \" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says. \"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\" That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage. At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play. \"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"\nClara Mbirini In rehearsals for Red or Dead in Liverpool which opens on Friday night\nBorn in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\". He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow. He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give. After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor. He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.\nGetty Images Mullan has worked steadily in film and television, including recent Amazon Prime blockbuster series The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\nMore recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party. Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry. \"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea. \"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\" He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty). \"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"\nGetty Images As a director, Mullan picked up a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for The Magdalene Sisters\nNormal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team. Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football. \"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\" It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive. \"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein – those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much. Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism? \"There's Alex Ferguson, who has lived to a ripe old age, but he's in the same camp. The last of those committed, nothing-else-but-football managers. They live and breathe it.\"\nGetty Images Mullan says Red or Dead is as much about fanaticism as it is about football",

      "content_en": "The singer selling out gigs - without releasing songs\n2 days ago Share Save Jonathan Geddes BBC News Share Save\nKerr Mercer Kerr Mercer has had lots of support from Stargazing singer Myles Smith\nHe is writing songs with Lewis Capaldi and swapping sweets with Teddy Swims, but anyone wanting to listen to rising pop star Kerr Mercer's music has a problem - because he hasn't released a song yet. The Lanarkshire singer's piano-led songs have seen him sell out gigs across the country and earn support slots with major bands. But he's decided to wait before bringing out any music so he can \"build a real fan base\". \"I just find it insane that people are wanting to come see me without any music being out,\" admits the teenager, who is from Uddingston.\nHowever, his unusual approach hasn't stopped him being backed by Lewis Capaldi, who has worked on a tune with the 18-year-old after a mutual connection in the music industry helped set up a collaboration between the two. \"Lewis has been absolutely class with me,\" he told BBC Scotland News. \"We met a few times and have now written a song together. When I was starting out I was covering his songs and now we're writing together - it's a bit mad to have people at that level interested in what I'm doing musically.\" Other than video clips shared on social media, no-one can hear Kerr's sensitive piano-led songs - a deliberate decision. \"I've seen so many artists on TikTok firing out a song a week but then not be selling out 200-capacity venues\", he explains. \"I'd rather sell out a tour than have a million streams on Spotify. One thing that'll never change is that real people want to go see gigs so I've just done lots of shows and supported folk. \"We did two headlines in Glasgow, selling out King Tut's. Then it was Saint Lukes, which is double the size of Tut's, and then a UK tour. I spoke to a few people and decided to try to push it out further with another tour.\"\nGetty Images Sam Cooke is a huge inspiration for Kerr\nThat tour will end on Sunday at the Garage in Glasgow, his biggest hometown gig yet. He jokes most of the people coming to those gigs are family members, which gently plays down his growing popularity. However, he has had plenty of family backing, taking singing and piano lessons as a child and getting a taste of the arts by appearing in pantomimes as a youngster, treading the boards at the Pavillion theatre. It came naturally to someone who admits he was \"always the class clown\" at school, and enjoyed being the centre of attention. By the age of 10 he was singing at a local song club, performing a Queen track on his first appearance. His musical roots come from the school run, however. \"I was in primary school in Uddingston and my sister was in secondary at Uddingstoon Grammar, so I had half an hour to wait before my grandad picked her up. He had a Sam Cooke record that would just play and before I knew it, I had all the words off by heart.\" That led to a love of classic soul - Otis Redding, Ray Charles, Etta James - that Kerr says is \"imprinted\" in his music to this day.\nThe Small Print PR Kerr Mercer started off playing open mic nights\nWhile he can't credit his family with blessing him with musical genes (\"there's not much music in my family other than karaoke\" he laughs) that hasn't stopped parents Kirsty and Robert offering support. And in his mum's case, some criticism... \"I could do the Brits and she'd tell me if I wasn't good,\" he says. \"As soon as I write a new song I'll send it to my mum and dad first. My dad is chill, he likes everything but me and my mum are very similar, so if I've not done my best, she'll tell me. \"I've played to thousands supporting Tom Walker and my mum was like 'you weren't at your best tonight' but then other times she goes 'that was outstanding'. \"More people are now telling me everything's going amazing but I only believe I've done well if I get the seal of approval from my mum.\"\n'Myles Smith called me a melt'\nHe has been backed by far more than his family now, having racked up support slots with a number of pop music heavyweights like Teddy Swims and Myles Smith. The advice of Stargazing singer Smith - the man with the best-selling British single in 2024 - has provided a big boost to Kerr, even if those words of wisdom are sometimes delivered tongue in cheek. \"I was home for Christmas and not sure what to do now that the tour was over. I got a message from Myles that simply read 'why don't you release a song, ya melt'. \"He's great though. It's not like the support act is always chilling with the headliner, but Myles was amazing about it. I was sitting in my dressing room and Myles burst in and was like 'why are you here, come have a beer with us' - then we would just sit talking about songs.\" He's now writing with an array of collaborators, and starting to record material with the aim of finally releasing songs later this year, adding that he's being a \"perfectionist\" about what should come out after such a wait. \"It's great fun too – you go for a day, write a song together and then go to the pub. There's not many jobs where you get put with two people you've never met, have a therapy session and then write a song about it.\"\nEPA Kerr has toured with the American rapper Teddy Swims",

Moving out from under the Branchform shadow\n4 days ago Share Save Philip Sim Political correspondent Share Save\nGetty Images John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon are close politically and personally\nNicola Sturgeon understandably says she's relieved to no longer be the focus of a police investigation. That feeling will be shared by many in the SNP. This has been a damaging period for the party and one that senior figures accept contributed to its collapse in last year's general election. Ms Sturgeon says she's ready to move on with her life - but will her party be able to do likewise and rebuild its political fortunes?\nShe described Operation Branchform as a cloud which has been hanging over her for years and that is absolutely the case for her party too. It is still a difficult day - the Crown is pressing ahead with charges of embezzlement against her husband Peter Murrell, a man who was critical to the running of the SNP for 20 years. As chief executive, he played a key role in transforming it into an election-winning machine. But he is not a household name the way Ms Sturgeon is. She's arguably the most famous woman in Scotland, indelibly linked to her party.\nGetty Images Humza Yousaf's time as first minister was overshadowed by the Operation Branchform investigation\nMs Sturgeon resigned in February 2023 and the Branchform investigation unfolded rapidly while Humza Yousaf was trying to get his feet under the table as her successor. It felt as though every time he was lining up an event or a statement to set out his leadership there would be a fresh development in Operation Branchform. That meant the public was largely introduced to Mr Yousaf as the man being doorstepped by reporters, saying things like \"of course I'm surprised one of my colleagues has been arrested\". The \"optics\" were also frankly disastrous when it came to a blue police tent being set up outside the home of Mr Murrell and Ms Sturgeon, and officers carrying stacks of boxes out of the party's HQ.\nThe police, incidentally, will forever defend the decision to deploy that famous tent. With the suburban street jammed with photographers and camera crews, they feel they had a duty to shield their sensitive work from view. In any case, senior figures in the party acknowledge that the investigation was a contributing factor to the huge losses they suffered in the 2024 general election. Mr Yousaf's self-inflicted exit from office, via a row with the Greens, was another. And then there was the UK-wide context of Labour sweeping the Tories from office. But these have also provided the chance for a clean break under John Swinney.\nGetty Images John Swinney had been leader of the SNP for barely two months when the party lost 39 seats compared to 2019 at the 2024 general election\nHe was extremely close politically and personally to Ms Sturgeon. As both SNP leader and first minister, he will hope Thursday's news is a chance to move on. He has already begun to rebuild the SNP's position in the polls, helped by Labour's struggles in adapting to government at Westminster. It has helped that he has not been dogged by daily updates from Operation Branchform the way his predecessor was. Mr Swinney has had a clearer shot at setting the agenda on his own terms. He's now hoping to head into the 2026 Scottish election campaign without constant questions about police inquiries. Ms Sturgeon is not even a candidate. And while being very careful of the legalities, he's also starting to reframe this from something which potentially, allegedly, happened within the SNP to something which potentially, allegedly, happened to it. The SNP has, in its decades in power, proved to be a master of reinvention. From a group happy to do budget deals with the Tories under Alex Salmond, to one allied with lefty Greens under Ms Sturgeon. Mr Swinney will hope he can craft yet another new - post-Sturgeon - identity, in order to retain power next year.\nGetty Images Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell were together at the centre of both the SNP and Scottish public life",

Cyclists taking part in the 114th edition of the Tour de France will set off from Edinburgh, with the start of the women's race - the Tour de France Femmes - to begin at a different UK location which has still to be announced. It is the first time both the men's and women's \"Grand Départs\" will be held in the same country. A full schedule for the event will be revealed in the autumn. Scotland, England and Wales will share six stages of the cycling event: three each for the men's and women's races.\nOrganisers will be hoping the Tour brings crowds of supporters as well as major economic and social benefits to the capital when the cyclists speed through in July 2027.\nWhy is the Tour coming to Edinburgh?\nThe men's version of the world's most famous cycling race has come to the UK four times before, in 1974, 1994, 2007 and 2014. These occasional appearances have proved very popular. Crowds at the roadside for the three English stages in 2014 were estimated at almost five million. What's new in 2027 is this will be the first time both the men's and women's events have come to the same nation in the same year. And it is the first time the Tour is coming to Scotland. The decision to bring the Tour to Edinburgh builds on a number of recent cycling events in Scotland, including the inaugural UCI Cycling World Championships in 2023. That saw more than a million spectators turning out over 11 days of action. And of course, Glasgow hosted the 2014 Commonwealth Games. They will be back in the city in 2026.\nWhat will the public be able to see?\nThe great thing about the Tour is it is free. As with similar events, including the annual Tour of Britain, nobody will have to pay to see the cyclists, you will simply have to turn up and grab a space on the route. Be warned, though, cycling fans are devoted to their sport and if you want a spot by the side of the road you will have to be prepared to get there early. The last time the Tour came to Britain there was enormous interest, with more than two million people coming out to watch. Cities and towns along the route saw crowds waiting patiently for the pelaton - the main group of riders - to pass.\nWhat benefits are there from hosting the Tour?\nPA Media The 2014 Tour started in Leeds and visited other parts of Yorkshire including Haworth\nA study of the economic and social impacts of hosting the Tour in Yorkshire in 2014 concluded that there were a number of major benefits from the two-day event, including: 2.3m visitors to the region.\n200,000 people visiting York.\nA £102.3m positive economic impact for Yorkshire.\n£8.3m economic boost for York.\n£7m spend from visitors to York.\n52% of attendees said they felt inspired to cycle more.\nA high interest in the event and the sport from younger people. A decade on, the legacy of that weekend appeared to be positive. There was even an annual cycling race set up - dubbed the Tour De Yorkshire - though that was cancelled after five years over funding issues and the effects of the Covid pandemic. Edinburgh will certainly hope for some of these positive outcomes when it hosts the 2027 event. Rob Dickson, director of industry and events at VisitScotland, said: \"The announcement that the Tour de France is coming to the UK, with Edinburgh set to host the prestigious Grand Départ in 2027, is fantastic news. \"As a world-class destination for tourism and events, Scotland's breathtaking landscapes, iconic venues, and rich history make it the perfect stage for the world's most famous bike race. \"With our renowned hospitality and passion for major events, we look forward to welcoming athletes and fans from around the globe. Major events like this not only showcase Scotland's stunning scenery but also inspire visitors to experience the thrill of cycling here for themselves.\" The 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships was credited with bringing \"significant economic benefits\" to Scotland, including more than £205m of economic activity and the equivalent of 5,285 jobs created over a year. An independent assessment credited the event with contributing to a \"more sustainable society\" in terms of promoting inclusion and accessibility and encouraging active travel.\nWill it turn Scots into cyclists?\nPA Media Retired Tour cyclist Mark Cavendish helped launch the 2027 event at Edinburgh Castle on Wednesday\nThat's certainly the hope of those who manage and promote the sport in Scotland. Speaking at the announcement on Wednesday, Scottish Cycling chief executive Nick Rennie said it was \"hard to underestimate\" the scale of the announcement and the impact it would have on cycling in Scotland. \"For the Tour de France to not only visit, but start in Scotland, is a huge milestone, not only for cycling but for sport in Scotland,\" he said. \"Over the last decade, Scotland has continued to build a reputation as an outstanding major event host, with the 2023 UCI Cycling World Championships further enhancing this. \"What that event 18 months ago did was raise people's awareness of the different types of cycling available, and that cycling is truly for everyone. \"With the Commonwealth Games returning to Glasgow next summer, and the Tour de France Grand Depart taking place in Edinburgh 12 months later, we really are in a golden era for cycling in Scotland.\"\nCyclist and bike-seller Dougal Brown is excited by the Tour announcement",

Edinburgh was unveiled recently as the venue for the Grand Depart but the route for the opening stage has not been revealed. Euan Jardine said he hoped the track record of the region in hosting cycling events could see the world's top racers pass through the area. The 2027 Tour de France stage routes are expected to be officially announced later this year.\nRace organisers confirmed Edinburgh would host the start of the men's race in the summer of 2027 earlier this month. General director Christian Prudhomme said Scotland would offer a \"magnificent backdrop\". Mr Jardine said he hoped the Borders could make a convincing case for the route to come through his region. He said Kelso's Oscar Onley could be a contender for a good finish in the race and the local authority would be working hard to ensure he could compete on roads near where he learned his skills.\nGetty Images Rising star Oscar Onley from Kelso could be among the racers in the Tour de France",

We'll be ready for that.\n\"We didn't get the result this time, but we're fortunate enough that we've got the chance to go and rectify that in a few months.\"\nHirst reflected on an \"awesome\" week in camp with Steve Clarke's side and has his eye on the summer friendlies to \"cement\" his spot.\n\"It's been an incredible week for myself, I couldn't have enjoyed it more, to be honest,\" he added.\n\"Bar the result (on Sunday), it's been absolutely awesome to be a part of it and see how it works.

A successor would be nice.\nJayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who won Olympic gold in 1984 and bronze in 1994, never thought they would be doing a farewell tour in 2025 still waiting for Great Britain to win another global figure skating medal.\nThey are hoping the wait may be nearly over with the emergence of Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson, who Torvill says have \"taken ice dancing in Great Britain to another level\".\nFear and Gibson are three-time European medallists and have come fourth at the past two World Championships. They head into this week's Worlds - which you can watch on the BBC - among the favourites for the podium in a season where they claimed Britain's first ever medal at the Grand Prix final.\nTorvill and Dean have been following their progress with interest for several years since first meeting them on the ice at Alexandra Palace, when the youngsters asked them to look at the programme they were working on.\n\"We sort of added a few little moves here and there, but I think what struck us right at the beginning was how well matched they were as a team, in stature and personality and ability,\" Dean said.\nFear, 25, and Gibson, 30, have continued to improve year on year, winning fans with their crowd-pleasing style of ice dance but also impressing judges with their technical skills.\nSo, could Fear and Gibson's Beyonce moves be about to finally take over from Torvill and Dean's Bolero and provide some new skating role models in Britain?\n\"We're retiring this year, so it would be nice to just hand that on to them,\" Dean said.\nWhat is different this year is that they have beaten some of their main podium rivals, including placing higher than world champions Madison Chock and Evan Bates to win Skate America and end a 15-year streak of American dominance.\n\"It's momentum in competition,\" Dean said. \"There's the word of mouth around the events, the judges, the panel, the public perception of them, how the audience react - it does influence.\"\nAs well as targeting Worlds success, Fear and Gibson have next year's Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina in sight.\nThe World Championships in Boston is a qualifying event for the Games, with quota places up for grabs.\nThey run from 25 to 30 March, with Fear and Gibson in action on Friday in the rhythm dance and Saturday in the free dance. The scores from both programmes are added together for the final result.\nTheir main podium rivals are likely to be Chock and Bates - who are going for a third title in a row - Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier and European champions Charlene Guignard and Marco Fabbri of Italy.",

The next step is to build the fully integrated prototype with a control system which the team expect to achieve later in 2025.\nThe development comes hot on the heels of Clyde Hydrogen achieving its first \"major\" technology milestone, announced in December 2024, when the business demonstrated it successfully produced hydrogen at pressures exceeding 100 bar using its scaled-up catalytic hydrogen generator.\nREAD MORE:\nMove to 'supercharge' Scotland's deep tech start-up scene revealed\nScots technology chief reveals investment target\nScottish golf technology company prepares to go to the next level\nClyde Hydrogen is a spin-out from the University of Glasgow’s School of Chemistry, a global leader in electrochemistry research. Its cutting-edge technology utilises a decoupled electrolysis process, including an electrochemical reductor which generates a reduced mediator solution and a catalytic hydrogen generator that produces high-pressure hydrogen gas.\nClyde Hydrogen said the successful demonstration of a semi-integrated prototype which can produce hydrogen continuously represents a \"significant technical validation\" of its technology, which is designed to convert low-quality, intermittent renewable power into clean hydrogen.\nJames Peck, CEO of Clyde Hydrogen, commented: “This is an important step for the team as it enables us to demonstrate that the system works continuously and gives confidence that we can begin the build of the full prototype in preparation for a commercial pilot project next year.”\nClyde Hydrogen is on track to deliver a fully integrated pilot system in 2025, and following this, plans to scale up to a commercial demonstrator, with the first market-ready product targeted for release by 2027.\nLast month, the business signed a memorandum of understanding with Hebrides-based green hydrogen producer and distributor, PlusZero, to demonstrate its \"groundbreaking\" decoupled electrolyser technology for the first time outside of the laboratory.\nBacked by pre-seed funding from Zinc, the University of Glasgow and grants from the Scottish Government’s Hydrogen Innovation Scheme (HIS) and the Net Zero Technology Centre (NZTC), Clyde Hydrogen is now ready to accelerate its growth.\nTo support its journey toward commercialisation, Clyde Hydrogen has launched a new funding round aimed at attracting up to £5m of new investment. The funds will enable the company to refine its production process, develop a production-ready system in 2026, and expand its team to meet the growing demand for hydrogen technology.",

      "content_en": "Mactaggart & Mickel has released the final block of apartments at Stewart Gardens, ready to move into now, with full LBTT paid and flooring throughout.\nPauline and Marc Cushing purchased a four bedroom Argyll duplex apartment in Stewart Gardens in November 2023, after a change in family circumstances led them to reconsider their needs. Previously, they lived in a spacious five bedroom detached home, also in Newton Mearns, with their two children Hayden (17) and Ayla (14) and Pauline’s elderly mother.\nAs their children grew older, and Pauline’s mother sadly passed away, the need for space lessened and they began their search for something different. “We loved our previous home, but it was simply too big for us,” Pauline explained.\n“After my mum passed, the house felt impractical, and with three levels, cleaning was a nightmare. We started looking for something that suited our needs better but still had enough space for our family.”\nMarc was immediately drawn to the apartments at Stewart Gardens, relishing the idea of a more manageable home that still maintained a luxurious feel. “When we first visited, I wasn’t sure if an apartment would work for a family of four,” Pauline admits. “But when we saw the space and layout, especially the size of the bedrooms, we were blown away.”\nThe generous room sizes were a huge selling point. “We wanted three big bedrooms, which is almost impossible to find,” Pauline continued. “The apartment solved that problem perfectly. Our son has the master bedroom downstairs, our daughter has a fantastic-sized room, and ours is so spacious that we even have a sofa and TV.”\nThe transition from a house to an apartment was a significant change, particularly with no garden, but it has proved to be a welcome one. “Marc has never been a fan of gardening, so he loves that we don’t have to worry about it anymore,” Pauline laughed. “And the balcony gets the sun all day, even in Scotland. It’s a lovely spot to relax.”\nThey’ve even made a few customisations to make their home their own, adding a wall to separate the kitchen from the living area for a cosier feel, and repurposing the fourth bedroom as a snug and office space. “The flexibility of the layout has been fantastic,” Pauline adds. “We also have so much storage, more than we did in our old house!”\nStewart Gardens’ location has allowed them to stay within the community they love. “We’re still a 15-minute walk from The Avenue shopping centre and the supermarket, which is great,” Pauline said. “There are plenty of buses nearby, making it easy for the kids to get to school or into town. The East Renfrewshire schools are also ranked some of the best in the country.”\nAs for the future, Pauline and Marc see their new apartment as their forever home. “With the lift access, even if we struggled with stairs in the future, we could easily adapt. We have more than enough space for the kids and even future grandchildren,” she said. “Honestly, we couldn’t be happier with our decision.”\nStewart Gardens’ premium residences boast open-plan layouts, spacious rooms, and high-quality finishes, ensuring a perfect balance of functionality and sophistication. Every apartment benefits from two allocated parking spaces, secure video entry, and lift access to the first and second floors, providing ease of living and security for all residents.\nThe development is ideally positioned on the western edge of Newton Mearns, just a short walk from The Avenue Shopping Centre and Parklands Health Club. With excellent transport links via the M77, Stewart Gardens offers effortless connectivity to Glasgow city centre, the Ayrshire coast and beyond.\nResidents can enjoy the best of both worlds – the vibrancy of city life and the tranquillity of open green spaces, with beautifully maintained communal gardens with pergola, seating and ample planting, creating a serene retreat from urban hustle and bustle.\nAmong the available homes are the last remaining three and four bedroom top-floor duplex apartments, offering an elevated standard of luxury living. The standout among these is the Argyll, a four bedroom duplex spanning 1,735 sq ft and offering panoramic views of Glasgow’s south side from its private Velux balconies.\nFrom the moment you step into the Argyll duplex, the sense of space and luxury is undeniable. The expansive hallway leads to a stylish open-plan lounge and kitchen, complete with fully integrated appliances and a generous dining area. French doors open onto a private balcony, allowing natural light to flood the living space while providing a perfect outdoor nook for relaxation. The lower floor hosts two large bedrooms, with the master bedroom featuring fitted wardrobes and private access to the bathroom.\nUpstairs, the second level offers two additional bedrooms with charming coombe ceilings and Velux windows that transform into balcony areas, inviting in fresh air and natural light. A separate shower room on the upper floor ensures convenience and privacy for the entire household. As the last available apartment of its kind in Stewart Gardens, this exquisite home is priced at £484,500.\nRegional Sales Director, Liz Cleghorn said: “The apartments at Stewart Gardens offer a unique combination of space, style, and functionality, making them an ideal choice for a wide range of buyers. Whether you're a young couple looking for a modern city escape, a family in need of more room to grow, or someone looking to downsize without sacrificing quality. These homes truly cater to everyone and we’re really happy to hear Pauline and Marc are delighted with their new home.\n“Each apartment is designed with the highest standards in mind. The open-plan living spaces create a sense of light and airiness, while the large bedrooms offer the perfect retreat. With high-quality fixtures, integrated kitchen appliances, and custom-fitted wardrobes, no detail has been overlooked.\n“We have been building homes in Newton Mearns for many years, and Stewart Gardens has truly exceeded expectations. With its location, outstanding design, and family-friendly features, it’s clear why these apartments are in such high demand. We encourage anyone considering a new home to visit us and experience the incredible quality for themselves – it’s not something you can truly appreciate from pictures alone.”\nPrices at Stewart Gardens start from £346,500. The sales office is open Thursday to Monday, 10am – 4pm.

Since 2014, IBioIC has helped to attract £35m in research and development funding for its 300 members.\n“Scotland has a thriving bioeconomy, and we’re pleased to see this latest commitment from the Innovate UK Launchpad programme to support new projects that will contribute to a greener future,\" said Liz Fletcher, director of business engagement at IBioIC.\n\"Bio-based manufacturing is key to achieving net zero targets and there are many possibilities for alternatives to fossil fuels emerging, backed by research and development. However, SMEs in this space face many challenges and to address these we are developing a range of activities as part of our role as the Launchpad cluster manager to support each participant to achieve their goals.”\nThe first stage of Launchpad in Scotland saw around £1.8m allocated to 13 projects and businesses focusing on the development of green fuels, polymers, and alternative foods, among other specialisms. Among these was SilviBio which received an award of £88,000 to further development of its peat-free plant propagation blocks for vegetable growers.\nIBioIC recently appointed Kirsty Neilson as its new programme manager to support the projects involved in each stage of the Launchpad initiative. She previously held the role of product development manager at Marine Biopolymers, a company extracting high-value components from brown seaweeds for use in a range of applications such as pharmaceuticals.\n“Being part of a start-up for over a decade means that, in some ways, I have already experienced and overcome many of the challenges that the Launchpad cohort may face, and I will be able to support them to navigate their next chapter of growth,\" Ms Neilson said.\n\"There are so many different sectors that come under the umbrella of industrial biotechnology, which makes it incredibly diverse and interesting.

And what would you say that hourly rate is?\"\nRead More on social care in Scotland:\nThe answer is £12 per hour, rising to £12.60 this year.\nNew figures published by The Herald revealed that workers in residential care are paid 27% less than the average UK worker, and their hourly pay is now below that of their counterparts in the rest of the country.\nOver 40,000 people in Scotland live in care homes, a figure which is only going to rise due to the ageing population, but low wages are fuelling a recruitment and retention crisis in the vital sector.\nKenny says: \"I started nine years ago and I think there are only four of us left. I’d say we have two-thirds of staff turnover every two years, it’s constant recruitment.\n“You’re in competition with other living wage employers who require less of their staff in terms of skills.\n\"All of the local fast food restaurants in our area pay more than we get paid. All of the supermarkets in our area pay more than we get paid – in fact, I struggle to name any employer in my area that pays less than what we get per hour.\n\"Even people who are passionate about the job, people who love the job and got into the job to genuinely help people who require it, don’t stay.\nSocial are is facing a retention crisis\n“Even if you love the job you have to pay the bills, and people leave – and that’s just the people who love the job.\n“This is a hard job with a lot of responsibility – why would people want that responsibility when they get nip next door to a retail job and be paid more?\n\"Our job is not a lowest amount job, you can’t attract people to a highly-skilled job by paying those rates and you can’t help the people we’re meant to help by paying those rates.\n“The Scottish Government know that, they’ve made a choice to put the money elsewhere. They may say otherwise but they’ve chosen to keep our wages at that rate..\n“The people we support and ourselves are hidden away in your community, we’re the quiet people who get on with their jobs.\n“We’re not the NHS angels, we’re not given this glorified status – which I believe the NHS deserve, by the way - because we’re in the private and charity sector we’re hidden away.\n“If it wasn’t for us being there quietly in the communities that we help, a lot of people would suffer.”\nThe high levels of staff turnover can also have a detrimental effect on residents.\nKenny says: \"With a lot of the people we support trust is a big issue, and personal interaction is a big issue.\n“For the people we support trust can take years to develop, and I don’t exaggerate that. They'll get used to one member of staff and then they're suddenly gone.\n\"Can you imagine your primary caregiver being changed on you every two months, and how that would affect you? If you had to get to know a new primary caregiver every two months?\n“It’s a vicious circle, because quite often when the people we support don’t get a balanced environment the way they respond to new people becomes what some may see as challenging.\n“If they had a stable long-term environment it would be easier for the new staff, but because it’s so constant it’s emotionally draining for both the people we support and the new staff coming in.\n“So, for the new recruits the job is harder than it should be.\n\"All the companies I’m aware of spend masses of money on agency, and I believe the NHS is the same. Ultimately they’ve got to provide somebody, but someone from an agency might come in to support someone for a day and then go away again.\n“I’ve just talked about the turmoil it can cause when people come in and they’re only there for a couple of months, so imagine what it’s like when agency staff come in for a day?”",

We get a pretty diverse range of crowds, to be honest.\"\nThe Wombats have very much built and maintained their following on the back of their albums and live shows.\nThe group hasn't had a top 100 charting single since 2011 but their last five albums have gone top five, with 2022's Fix Yourself, Not the World going to number one.\nMr Haggis says: \"We love playing live so much. That's where we started and like where we will end, that's where it all kind of comes together and makes sense.\n\"I think like the crowds over the years just feed off that and we feed off them, it's always just like a pretty joyous, rowdy occasion.\n\"Getting a number one album was a little surprising, but lovely.\n\"It's kind of arbitrary getting a number one because if you'd have released it a week later with the same amount of sales, it could have been number three and it wouldn't have made any difference to what the actual album was and how people individually feel about it.\n\"So for us, it's not the be all and end all. But it is definitely a good sign that there are people out there who love guitar music and I don't think it ever really goes away.\n\"We're lucky that we've got like a little army of Wombats fans who get out there and support us and hopefully, you know, if there are younger bands out there grabbing a guitar and a bass and drums the good thing with having a charting album is that then they go, 'oh, see, there are bands that are playing guitars that still doing well'.\"\nTestament to their unprecedented popularity, The Wombats will headline Glasgow's Hydro on March 25 - the biggest show they've ever played in the city.\nThe drummer says: \"We've always been so spoiled by Scottish crowds in general and Glasgow always has been one of the rowdiest most fun places ever since we first drove up there ourselves to King Tut's to support The Dykeenies in, I think, 2005.\n\"It was just like such a warm welcome, similar to Liverpool, just really warm, friendly people and also music lovers - it runs deep, doesn't it?\n\"To go from King Tut's all the way back then to like playing an arena is going to be a pinch yourself moment for sure and we can't wait.\n\"This tour is the first arena tour we've done. We've done we have done the O2 before, we've done Leeds Arena and certain arenas over the years but never in one go.\n\"But for us in all honesty playing the Barrowlands is such an insane experience.\n\"I'm sure playing an arena will still be great - it's just going to be a slightly bigger version of doing a Barrowlands show.\n\"We played the O2 Arena last album round and one of the things that we heard from people was, 'oh, even though it's such a big venue, it felt very intimate.\n\"Maybe it's because we come from that world that we still we want it to feel as intimate as possible, it just means there's more people singing along than there would be at a smaller show, really.\"",

Care workers are vulnerable because they care about what they do, that’s why they work for the money they do.\n“They aren’t there for the money, it’s because they care about what they’re doing. And I think care homes exploit that.”",

      "content_en": "They also express concerns over the plans to give anyone who has had their dog stolen the opportunity to give a victim statement, an option currently only open to the victims of the most serious of crimes.\nMeanwhile, the Law Society of Scotland says the new offence would “have a very limited impact in increasing the number of people convicted” unless there was more money for police and the courts.\nHowever, there is strong support for the legislation from animal charities including Guide Dogs, Dogs Trust, and the Scottish SPCA.\nREAD MORE\nMr Golden’s Bill — which is currently making its way through Holyrood — will create a new standalone statutory offence of dog theft.\nIt suggests the penalties could be up to five years imprisonment and an unlimited fine.\nThe MSP argues that the current common law offence of theft focuses too heavily on monetary value, rather than on the emotional significance of dogs as both sentient beings and family members.\nIt also seeks to create a statutory aggravation to the offence for the theft of an assistance dog. This would apply regardless of whether the dog was working at the time it was stolen.\nIt would also seek to amend the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 to classify dog theft as a prescribed offence, allowing those who have had their dogs taken to submit a victim impact statement in any court, summary or solemn, about how the theft affected them emotionally, physically, or psychologically.\nCurrently, statements can only be made by victims and family members of victims in solemn cases, those dealing with the most serious crimes, including murder, rape, abduction, some assaults, housebreaking and some crimes of violence.\nThat could mean someone whose dog was stolen could make a statement in a case that wasn’t heard by a jury but only by a Sheriff, while a victim of assault being dealt with in a summary court would not.\nIn the high court, someone whose dog has been stolen could make a statement, but someone who is the victim of human trafficking or domestic abuse would not be able to do so.\nCOPFS warns that there are “practical and resource implications of the extension of the scheme to cover the theft of a dog.”\nThey state: “It is respectfully suggested the draft provisions create an anomaly within the criminal justice system whereby a victim impact statement can be given for theft of dog when it is not open to victims to provide such a statement in many other scenarios including for charges in the solemn courts.\n“In addition, the introduction and expansion of this scheme to include all offences relating to the theft of a dog would have financial consequences and time constraints.”\nThey argued that information about the emotional impact can already be made available to the court through evidence or narrative.\nThey also point out that Scottish Ministers already have the power to modify the list of prescribed offences without the need for primary legislation.\nIn their submission, they also pointed out that the proposed penalties are no different from the sentencing disposals already available, and that existing common law already covers the theft of any pet, not just dogs.\nMaurice Goden with spaniel (Image: PA)Mr Golden’s Bill has cross-party support in Holyrood, with all of the Tory MSPs backing the legislation as well as MSPs from the SNP, Labour, Lib Dems and Greens.\nOffering their support for the new offence, the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association said the law failed “to recognise the deep emotional bond between dogs and their owners, meaning sentences are often disproportionately lenient.\"\nThey added: \"For guide dog owners, theft will have life-changing consequences... If a dog were stolen, the loss would be far more abrupt and damaging, leaving the handler without vital support for mobility and independence.\"\n\"The inclusion of an aggravation for the theft of an assistance dog is essential to ensuring that the justice system recognises the severe impact of such a crime.\"\nThey argued that “no alternative approaches to addressing dog theft would be as effective, enforceable, or comprehensive as introducing a standalone offence.\"\nREAD MORE\nThe Dogs Trust argues that standalone legislation “would be a positive step in recognising dogs as sentient and to truly take into account the welfare impact on both the stolen dog and their owner.\"\nThe Law Society of Scotland take a “neutral view” on the creation of a new offence, though they “consider that the sentencing process already recognises the emotional harm that dog abductions may produce in victims, in the scope of the common law offence of theft.\"\n\"If more resources are not provided to criminal justice institutions, the creation of new offences will have a very limited impact in increasing the number of people convicted,” they add\nThe committee is set to take evidence from the COPFS, Police Scotland and the charities on Wednesday.",

      "content_en": "Starmer has defended the cuts as necessary to combat “devastating” increases in the sickness and benefits disability bill, which is estimated to rise to £70 billion a year by 2030.\nIn Scotland, where welfare funding is devolved, a proportionate cut to the Treasury block grant would take place, similar to what happened when winter fuel payments were axed last autumn.\nSpeakers addressed the crowd from the Royal Concert Hall steps. (Image: Josh Pizzuto-Pomaco) Tressa Burke is the CEO of Glasgow Disability Alliance. She says the cuts do not reflect the “dignity and respect” disabled people deserve.\n“When times get tough, the government gets tough on disabled people”, Burke says.\n“The government is supposed to be helping people get access to work. This will not do that, but it will put people into poverty. Where is the dignity and the respect that disabled people deserve?\n\"Disabled people live with deep and long term inequality. A recent survey we conducted of disabled people living in Glasgow found that 79% are not able to access services, 91% deal with social isolation, and 71% can’t pay their bills.\"\nBurke added: “Disabled people are feeling afraid and are being scapegoated for the country’s debt. Instead of these cuts, we would appreciate more investment in social security and wider public services.”\nSeveral dozen disabled people, careers, and activists gathered at the top of Buchanan Street on Thursday evening to protest the cuts.\nAhead of the rally, the organiser, Euan Mitchell of Disabled People Against Cuts Glasgow, told The Herald he couldn’t stand by and not speak out.\nEuan Mitchell helped to organise the protest. (Image: Josh Pizzuto-Pomaco) “These cuts to disability services and to disabled people’s benefits are some of the most horrendous I've ever seen”, said Mitchell, a disabled person who also cares for a family member.\n“These are further attacks to the finances of people who are already taking on a large burden. People are already on their knees and this is just going to make it worse.\n“We’re getting to a situation where disabled people are going to become a hidden group in society. No amount of attacks on society’s poorest and most vulnerable people are going to fix the financial issue that has been created. We don’t keep disabled people safe by cutting their money.\"\nMitchell compared the current situation to the first wave of austerity instituted by the Tories in 2010.\nHe said: “Back then, the number of disabled people who died was horrendous, some through starvation, others from taking their own lives. Similarly, this just feels like the government is kicking a group when they’re already down.\n“There’s a lot of fear, but one of the things which can combat fear is people thinking they can make a difference and come together and realise they’re not alone.”\nFiona Robertson is a writer and disability activist from Aberdeen.\nShe told The Herald: “I can't really describe the despair in the disability community right now. We've spent fourteen years being the target of repeated, brutal austerity cuts which caused so much suffering and death, and most people had believed a Labour government would be the end to that, and we'd finally get the support we need to live our lives.\n“But the 'hard decisions' are never about making themselves unpopular with big donors, and are always about making life harder for sick and poor people.”\nFiona Robertson is a writer and disability activist (Image: Josh Pizzuto-Pomaco) Robertson added: “Using standard stigma about disabled people who can't work to target PIP is calculated and cruel, as it is not a work-replacement benefit. But even with the push to 'get disabled people into work' - the problem does not lie with us. We don't need CV help and confidence building.\n“Yes, many disabled people could do some work, but that might be four hours a week, at unpredictable times because of the variability of their condition. Many will need to work from home to avoid exacerbating their conditions.\n“If you want more disabled people in work, the only way to do that is to incentivise employers to be more inclusive, not to torture disabled people by withdrawing support we need to survive to try to get us into jobs which don't exist.”\nScottish Labour stalwart and former MSP Neil Findlay left the party in protest last week over the plans.\nIn a letter to Keir Starmer, Findlay wrote: “As political leaders like you, Mr Starmer, and your colleague Wes Streeting seek to stigmatise those with a mental illness and take money from those suffering from cancer, multiple sclerosis or heart disease, you accept hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of freebies; financial donations, clothing, glasses and tickets to football matches and pop concerts.\n“Tell me who is really milking the system? Of course it's one rule for you and another rule for the poor, the sick and disabled.\"",

      "content_en": "Hostelling Scotland, a registered charity with 29 youth hostels and 24 affiliate hostels across the country, has created Happy Hosteller Breaks as part of its \"longstanding commitment to supporting young people and communities\".\nThe launch coincides with the fifth anniversary of the outbreak of Covid-19, which stymied the charity’s income and consequently restricted its youth action work.\nThis marks the revival of its flagship residential programme, and comes after Hostelling Scotland funded more than 200 residential trips over the past decade, helping at least 6,000 people access unforgettable experiences.\nThe new initiative resumes this activity, supported by membership contributions and donations, and aimed at organisations such as schools, early years centres, registered charities in Scotland working with disadvantaged young people and families, and other youth groups\nHere, Margo Paterson, chief executive of Hostelling Scotland, outlines what drives the organisation.\nWhat is your organisation called?\nOur official name is Scottish Youth Hostels Association, a not-for-profit charity established in 1931 with a mission to inspire all – especially young people – to explore and experience Scotland. However, the lifestyles and expectations of modern travellers are ever-changing, and to reflect this, we rebranded as Hostelling Scotland in 2017. This fresh identity better resonates with a new generation of hostellers while still embracing the strong community values at the heart of our organisation.\nWhere is it based?\nOur head office is in Stirling, but our reach extends far beyond. We operate 29 hostels across Scotland, spanning diverse and unique locations. From the vibrant streets of Leith Walk in Edinburgh to the pristine sands of Achmelvich Beach on the North Coast 500, from Port Charlotte on Islay to our remote eco-hostel at Loch Ossian, our network showcases the very best of Scotland’s landscapes and culture.\nWhat does it do?\nAt its core, Hostelling Scotland provides safe, affordable, and welcoming accommodation for those keen to explore Scotland, whether solo travellers, families, school groups, or international visitors. More than just a place to stay, we foster a sense of community and inclusivity, ensuring guests from all cultures and backgrounds feel at home.\nREAD MORE:\nAs a charitable organisation, we are committed to removing barriers to travel. Our youth programmes and partnerships, such as Shared Care Scotland’s Respitality Programme, provide invaluable opportunities for young people and families who might not otherwise have the chance to experience a holiday. Hostelling is about adventure, connection, and accessibility, and we strive to make that possible for as many people as we can.\nWho are your customers?\nWe welcome everyone, with a special focus on young people. Our doors are open to individual travellers, families, school and youth groups, as well as domestic and international visitors seeking an authentic Scottish experience. In 2024, we hosted 332,977 overnights, a testament to the continued appeal of hostelling in Scotland.\nHow many people do you employ?\nWith a seasonal operating model, our workforce fluctuates throughout the year. At peak season we have a team of 200 dedicated employees, many of whom return year after year, drawn by their passion for hospitality and Scotland’s great outdoors.\nWhy did you take the plunge, and what were you doing before?\nI had already been part of Hostelling Scotland as Deputy CEO and felt a deep connection to the organisation’s mission. When the opportunity arose to lead as CEO, it was a natural step. Having dedicated almost 24 years to the organisation, I remain as passionate as ever about evolving the hostelling experience and expanding our reach, particularly for young people and families. With our 100th anniversary in 2031 on the horizon, I feel privileged to be steering the organisation towards an exciting future.\nWhat do you least enjoy?\nI love the variety of my role – visiting our hostels, connecting with teams, planning for the future, and learning from international colleagues. However, like many in leadership, I sometimes wish there were more hours in the day! We have so many ambitions, but funding constraints can limit how quickly we can realise them. That can be frustrating, but it also makes every achievement all the more rewarding.\nWhat are your ambitions for Hostelling Scotland?\nTo cement our place as Scotland’s leading hostelling organisation and ensure that more young people, families, and groups experience the joy, adventure, and community spirit of hostelling.\nREAD MORE:\nWe want to modernise our hostels, continue enhancing our sustainability efforts, and broaden access to travel through our youth and community programmes.\nWhat would most help you achieve this?\nIncreased funding and investment would allow us to expand and enhance our hostel network, making it even more accessible and appealing. More importantly, it would allow us to reach more young people and families who would benefit from travel, outdoor experiences, and cultural exploration.\nWhat is the most valuable lesson you have learned?\nIt all comes down to people. Hostelling is far more than buildings and beds – it’s about the experiences, connections, and warmth that our team brings to every guest. Our success is built on the dedication of our staff, volunteers, and supporters, and by continuously listening to our guests, we can evolve to meet their needs and exceed their expectations.\nWhat has been your best moment as CEO?\nThere have been so many. But what always makes me proud is seeing the direct impact of our work – whether it’s a young person experiencing their first trip to Scotland’s Highlands, a family enjoying a well-earned break, or international travellers forming lifelong friendships in our hostels. Watching people discover Scotland through hostelling is an incredibly rewarding experience.\nAnd the worst?\nWithout a doubt, having to close our network during the COVID-19 pandemic. The uncertainty, the impact on our staff and communities, and the loss of opportunities for so many travellers and young people were incredibly difficult to navigate. However, we emerged stronger, more resilient, and even more committed to our mission.\nHow do you relax?\nTime with family and friends is essential for me, and I make sure to prioritise exercise –whether that’s in the gym or out in Scotland’s great outdoors. Staying active helps me clear my mind and stay focused on the road ahead.",

      "content_en": "It will also investigate how quintessentially Scottish confections such as shortbread and empire biscuits became embedded in Scottish national identity.\nThe day-long event will take place at Mackintosh at the Willow, one of a number of tea rooms established in Glasgow in the 19th and 20th centuries as the city’s growing temperance movement took hold.\nRead More:\nThe organisers described the venue as a “fitting tribute” to tea’s cultural significance, and the part this and other tearooms played in transforming Scots’ social lives.\nBy providing an alternative to pub drinking culture, tearooms offered women spaces to meet friends, and changed tea from a luxury for the rich to a pleasure accessible to ordinary people.\n“Tearooms and tea revolutionised how Scots socialised,” food historian Dr Lindsay Middleton explained.\n“They created artistic spaces centred around tea rather than alcohol, particularly transforming social opportunities for women as both customers and entrepreneurs.\n“Tea is inherently part of Scottish identity, but its rich history points to Scotland’s links with the rest of the world.\n“At the symposium we are keen to explore that history and showcase how the now-humble cup of tea came to be so culturally ubiquitous.”\nThe Willow Tea Rooms were founded in 1903 by Kate Cranston, daughter of a Glasgow tea merchant and firm temperance advocate.\nThey were part of a series of “art tearooms” she established in collaboration with architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife Margaret Macdonald, and provide what the organisers said will be a “stunning” architectural setting for the symposium.\nDr Middleton went on: “We are thrilled to be collaborating with Mackintosh at the Willow and the National Trust for Scotland to deliver the 2025 annual Scottish Food Heritage Symposium, which will highlight how the history of Scottish food and drink can be used as a tool for learning and connecting with our cultural and culinary heritage.”\nPeter Gilchrist from Tenement Kitchen, which is organising the symposium alongside the University of Glasgow, said the event comes at a time when there is “a lot more excitement” about the topic of Scottish food heritage.\n“People want to talk about their food memories, share family recipes and find out more about where exactly their food comes from,” he said.\nHe added: “Tea has been an (integral) part of Scottish life and Glasgow trade for centuries. What’s really exciting this year is that we get to celebrate female entrepreneurship as part of the programme of events.\n“How many people know that the tearoom was invented by a Glasgow woman?”\nOliver Braid, National Trust for Scotland’s creative learning manager at Mackintosh at the Willow, said: “The Scottish tearoom phenomenon of the late 19th and early 20th centuries is increasingly recognised for its cultural and culinary significance, shaping Scotland’s food, drink, and social histories of gender, race and class.”\nThe programme includes a talk by writer Perilla Kinchin on the history of Kate Cranston’s tea rooms, as well as historical talks on tea smuggling, the dark history of sugar as a product of Caribbean slavery, and how sugar became part of Scotland’s national identity.\nIt also features a session on the “creative confections” inspired by the rise of afternoon tea, such as shortbread and the empire biscuit, and the recipes that defined Scottish tea-taking rituals.",

      "content_en": "The Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland (CTUS), an independent foundation offering grants to support access to higher education, commissioned a poll on Scotland's “value, accessibility and funding of higher education” in Scotland.\nConducted by Ipsos Public Affairs, the poll showed widespread support for some form of Scottish Government-funded tuition. However, there was significant variation on how that should be implemented and who should be targeted for support.\nAlmost half (48%) of participants supported charging university tuition fees based on ability to pay, particularly if government funding was focused on those with lower household incomes, those who face historical barriers to entry, or those studying courses where there are skills shortages, such as nurses or engineers.\nLess than one-third (29%) directly opposed the idea.\nGeneral support for change but division on the direction\nScottish universities charge tuition fees for undergraduate degrees, with limits set by the Scottish and UK Governments. How much each student pays depends on their chosen university, where they live, whether or not they have previously attended university, and whether they are studying full-time or part-time.\nThe Scottish Government covers all tuition fees for full-time students living in Scotland and attending a Scottish university for their first undergraduate degree. The government's per student rate is dependent on the subject of study, and includes a standard £1,820 fee per student.\nThe government only covers tuition for part-time Scottish students if their household income is below £25,000.\nNon-Scottish students pay tuition fees at different rates, depending on whether they live in the UK. Students from the rest of the UK pay a set rate of £9,535 per year, while fees for international students are much higher, depending on the course and at the discretion of each university. Some range as high as £50,000 per year.\nParticipants were divided on whether the Scottish Government should cover the costs for all first-time undergraduate students living in Scotland (44%) or focus on low-income students while those whose households can afford it pay at least some of the cost of tuition (43%).\nFully government-funded tuition for all first-time undergraduates was most popular among those living in higher-income households of over £100,000 annually, those with children at home, younger age groups, and those who attended university.\nThe poll also asked participants to consider potential options for changing the tuition model in Scotland.\nThe most popular option was charging tuition fees based on ability to pay (48%). Under this system, students from lower-income households would pay low or no fees, and students from higher-income households would pay more.\nOpinions on this strategy differed depending on participants' household incomes. Charging tuition to those more able to pay was generally less popular among higher income brackets.\nRequiring employers to pay some contribution to the cost of university education was the second most popular option (39%).\nAnother favoured option was to charge tuition fees to all undergraduate students living in Scotland, with loans available that would only start being paid back once graduates began earning above a certain income level (35%). Many respondents, however, were opposed to this (43%).\nThe idea of a graduate tax, which would require all university graduates to pay a higher income tax once they earn above a certain level, was the least popular option (26% supported) and had the most direct opposition (48% opposed).\nParticipants were also asked what level of annual tuition fee they thought was reasonable to charge an undergraduate for a four-year degree. Opinion was relatively evenly split on fees up to £5,000 per year.\nThe most popular annual fee rate was between £3,000 and £4,999 (22%), followed by £1,500-£2,999 (21%) and less than £1,500 (20%).\nTargeted tuition support a popular strategy\nIf the government were to begin offering targeted tuition support, nearly two-thirds participants said low-income students should be the highest priority, followed by students studying courses where there are skill shortages, such as nursing (59%), and then students from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nParticipants also clearly supported government funding to prioritise apprenticeships, grants for disadvantaged students, and upskilling for existing workers.\nRead more\nIn response to the poll results, CTUS announced it was commissioning a Citizen Jury to assemble a representative sample of Scots to investigate the higher education funding and make recommendations.\nHannah Garrow, Chief Executive of the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, said the question of funding is “complex” and has long-ranging consequences for families and society.\n”However, recent discussions on how to finance higher education feel like they are stuck on repeat, while, for many people, funding continues to be seen as a barrier to access\".\n“This research shows that there is room for a more nuanced and open discussion on priorities for funding. If politicians are struggling to come up with solutions, perhaps the public can inject some democratic innovation into the debate.\n\"The government has already committed to lead the development of a new funding model so understanding the views of the public as beneficiaries and users of the system is critical.\n“We hope that the Scottish Government and all political parties in Scotland will get behind our Citizen Jury and commit to giving its outcomes careful consideration.\"\nPoll comes as universities face funding uncertainty\nThe publication of the Ipsos and CTUS poll comes only days after new data showed a sharp decline in the number of fee-paying international students at Scottish universities, a key source of income for many institutions.\nMultiple universities are facing financial challenges, with an estimated eight of 18 expected to report deficits when the newest sector analysis is released. Most recently, the University of Dundee announced a deficit and controversial draft recovery plan that includes cuts to 632 jobs, but other universities, including the University of Edinburgh—which has forecast a £140 million deficit over 18 months—are also looking to close gaps in their budget.\nThe Scottish Government has remained committed to providing free tuition for Scottish students, but university leaders are increasingly calling for a nuanced conversation about the amount of funding that the government provides.",

However, the quality of her work is presenting opportunities and advancement - including the launch of a third independent show next month.\nTeacher turned artist, Dawn Spence (Image: Maria Reingolt Photography )\nThe Glasgow-based painter, who names Yayoi Kusama and Shawn Huckins as influences, will present at the Alchemy Experiment in the West End next month during an exhibition running from April 4-11. Opening night on the Friday lasts from 7-9 and there’s an artist's talk the following Wednesday, offering an opportunity to hear the story behind the project. The launch evening is a celebration with drinks, friends and family all expected, presenting Spence a chance to share the creative process with her biggest supporters.\n“I want my exhibitions to be a chance for people to chat to me as an artist, because, I don’t want to be a hidden artist,” she smiles. Recently Spence was featured at Green Gallery and Lemond Gallery. Before the end of the year there are trips to MUST wine in London and the Pittenweem Arts festival.\nIt was during a week in Florence last year, is a city known for a painting or two, that Spence encountered the inspiration for her latest show titled ‘Freedom’.\nRead more Herald arts:\nInvesting in an oil painting course to acquire skills not taught in her local studies with the funds earned from previous exhibitions, sessions learning the techniques of classics like Sandro Botticelli provided ideas and inspiration for her next series of work.\n“I called this exhibition ‘Freedom’ because I was really interested in fabric folds, transparent fabrics and how they, for want of a better phrase, whisper in the wind. It reminds me of a wedding day - throwing the veil over a sunset and revealing something previously unseen.\n“I want people to see my work and feel really uplifted and joyful. It’s not about people coming in and feeling under pressure to understand my art, but just appreciate it.”\nSpence’s work is immersing and combines contemporary, abstract, surrealist and landscape themes. It’s hard to fit into a box, she admits. Perhaps that is why her work stands out and leaves so clear an impression on untrained eyes like this correspondent’s.\nDawn Spence: It’s so important to understand the time, effort and inspiration of creating a work (Image: Maria Reingolt Photography )\n“I guess I’m not just painting typical landscapes, the style I’ve developed over time fits with my desire for people to see new perspectives. Seeing something heavenly, something really warm and inviting. Even if those coming to my show don't like art, or they don't see the value in it, hopefully they step away going, ‘I've never seen that before’.”\nSpeance’s style “repeats strokes” to connote vibrancy and pulsations. “For me, it's almost a therapeutic way of looking at something.”\nAnd art, in all its forms, has never been more important, has it? As our algorithms tell us AI will replace every hard-honed skill by tomorrow and everything appears on demand at the touch of a screen, there is a strength in the creatives who value process and a human touch that can never quite be manufactured or cloned.\n“Especially with AI impacting art, people maybe think, ‘How easy it is to create that’? But it’s so important to understand the time, effort and inspiration of creating a work,” adds Spence. “It’s about what the artist has done to get to that moment and it’s the story behind reaching that point too, isn’t it?”\nFor Spence, it’s the story that makes this exhibition extra special, inviting others into her own journey by sharing new perspectives.\nFind out more about 'Freedom' by Dawn Spence at The alchemy experiment",

      "content_en": "It is one of ten early Byrne works which were bought from him by his local parish priest, Father Tom Jamieson in Renfrew, Renfrewshire, in the early 1970s.\nThe artwork was created as a study for a larger painting and is estimated at £10,000 to £15,000.\nThe 10 works will be sold by auction house Lyon & Turnbull live and online on April 2.\nREAD MORE:\nJohn Byrne — Life and times of the slab boy outsider\nJohn Byrne obituary: Artist leaves 'outstanding' legacy\nJohn Byrne on art, faith, fatherhood ... and mortality\nByrne became friends with Father Jamieson when the artist and his family lived on Paisley Road, Renfrew, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, bonding over a shared love of music and culture.\nThe priest bought work from Byrne, who worked from his studio garage in the back garden.\nByrne’s daughter Celie Byrne, also an artist, spoke of Father Jamieson and George Harrison visiting their house while she and her brother were small.\nIn an interview filmed for Lyon & Turnbull’s social media platforms, she said: “I remember Father Jamieson from when I was tiny. He would come round to the house quite regularly.\n“They would sit and talk about work, and he went out to the garage looking at my dad’s artwork and what he was working on.\nEach of The Beatles is pictured with a spirit animal (Image: Stewart Attwood/PA)\n“I just remember him being really lovely and I always remember his stripy scarf.”\nShe added: “We were wee obviously but apparently George Harrison came to the house twice in Renfrew for dinner.”\nThe sale also features a piece commissioned by Scottish folk musician Donovan in 1971 for the cover of HMS Donovan, an album of children’s songs.\nThe original oil painting for this is estimated at between £6,000 and £8,000.\nAll works in the collection of Father Tom Jamieson were produced during Byrne’s “Patrick” era, during which the Glasgow School of Art graduate signed the majority of his work with his father’s first name and pretended to be a “primitive” self-taught artist to attract the interest of the London art world.\nPaisley-born Byrne, creator of TV show Tutti Frutti and the play The Slab Boys, died on November 30, 2023 aged 83.\nJohn Byrne was renowned as an artist and playwright\nOther works in the sale include the large painting Homage a Hockney, 1970, which is expected to fetch between £20,000 and £30,000.\nIt was created to coincide with David Hockney’s major retrospective exhibition at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, in 1969-1970.\nAnother monumental work is Untitled (Musician), c. 1973-1975, also with an estimate of £20,000 to £30,000.\nCharlotte Riordan, Lyon & Turnbull’s head of contemporary & post-war art, said: “This is an amazing collection of John Byrne’s work. Father Jamieson clearly had a keen eye for artistic talent, seeing great promise in a man who would go on to make his own distinctive and indelible mark on Scottish, and indeed British, cultural life.\n“The Beatles painting was a precursor to a larger version, created for his 1969 December show at London’s Portal Gallery.\n“This was a reference and reaction to the fact that Portal attracted a star-studded clientele, with some of the biggest names in British showbusiness at the time becoming frequent visitors. Clients included; Julie Christie, Michael Caine, David Niven, David Bailey, The Beatles – particularly Ringo Starr who is thought to own ‘Patrick’ paintings – and Brian Epstein.\n“The painting was purchased by the art director and graphic designer Alan Aldridge, who went on to use it as the frontispiece to The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics, published in 1969. It was later used as the cover of The Beatles Ballads LP 12 years later.\n“Rumours suggest the original large-scale work was lost by EMI records, and so this work being offered for sale by Lyon & Turnbull is a rare surviving early version.\n“There is only one other known example, in a private collection in America.\n“We anticipate a great deal of interest in the sale and look forward to some spirited bidding at home and abroad.”",

The new draft plan development process began with independent consultation, which took place through surveys, community drop-in sessions in Kirkwall, Stenness and Dounby, and engagement with local businesses, community groups, membership organisations, and education providers.\nREAD MORE:\nDig It: How Orkney’s archaeology is stealing the show on the small screen\nThe 'extraordinary' neolithic village in Scotland that's older than the Pyramids\nNeolithic site to be returned to green fields after dig\nThe draft plan builds on previous measures to further mitigate the site’s vulnerability to climate change, which threatens communities, environments and world heritage sites across the globe.\nThe Heart of Neolithic Orkney is vulnerable to the sea level changes, precipitation changes, and storm intensity and frequency increases that Scotland and other places are experiencing on a more elevated scale.\nThe consultation is also seeking views on how to further balance access to tourists and residents while maintaining the Heart of Neolithic Orkney’s \"outstanding universal value\". Increased footfall can also contribute to erosion of sites - particularly at the Ring of Brodgar, where measures have been introduced to alleviate the impact on the monument and surrounding area, such as a one-way system and alternating routes around the site.\nInput is being sought from across the islands and beyond to further shape the direction of the plan. The draft plan also lays out how continued engagement with Orkney communities, including the infrastructure surrounding the site, will be a focal point in the sites’ management for the next 10 years, which emerged as a key priority from consultations with the public.\nDr James Bruhn, Head of World Heritage and Heritage Policy at HES, said: \"As one of Scotland’s seven World Heritage sites, the Heart of Neolithic Orkney is an integral part of Scotland’s story with international appeal, and how we look after it, share and celebrate it is hugely important.\nSkara Brae “We’re keen to hear from as many people as possible as part of the consultation and would encourage those who wish to help shape the next ten years for the Heart of Neolithic Orkney, and be part of its continuing story, to take part.”\nCouncillor Heather Woodbridge, Leader of Orkney Islands Council, said: “The Heart of Neolithic Orkney - encompassing four incredible sites in the West Mainland - is vital to the ongoing story that weaves through Orkney’s past, present and future.\n\"The community of Orkney has looked after these sites for generations, particularly in terms of providing a warm welcome to those who come to our shores to visit them.\n“As we face the challenges of climate and changing visitor patterns, it is important that we take the time to review, alongside our partners, how the sites are being managed now and into the future.\n“Our community are an important part of this - and I’d encourage them to make their views known.”\nThe consultation closes on Tuesday May 13.",

So, we now need to make sure that we do realise those efficiency savings so we can invest in the priorities.”\nDuring the interview, the Chancellor also refused to rule out slashing tax on tech giants.\nThere have been reports that the government might consider changing or ditching the Digital Services Tax, which imposes a 2% levy on the profits of firms like Facebook, in order to avoid the global tariffs that the Trump administration is planning to impose.\nAsked if this was true, Ms Reeves said the UK is in discussions \"around a whole range of things\" with the US related to tariffs.\n\"But we will continue to operate on that principle that you should pay taxes in the country in which you operate.\"\nAsked if she might tweak the tax, she said: \"You've got to get the balance right, and those discussions at the moment are ongoing.\n\"We want to make progress. We do not want to see British exporters subject to higher tariffs, and we want to see trade barriers fall right across the world.\"\nREAD MORE\nIn his interview, Mr Leishman also said his party has not done enough for the 400 workers at Grangemouth being made redundant.\nThe MP suggested using the redevelopment of Manchester United’s Old Trafford stadium as a bargaining chip.\nThe club is owned by billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is chairman and chief executive of the site’s part-owners, Ineos.\nPlans for the new stadium were announced earlier this year, but the club is looking for Government support to regenerate the surrounding area. The money for which, Mr Leishman says, should be withheld if the refinery closes.\n“When we look at the regeneration needed around Old Trafford, why would we not say you can have that money, but you need to keep Grangemouth open? That’s just negotiation in my opinion,” he told the magazine.\n“I have asked those questions of why we haven’t done this, and the answers have been underwhelming.”",

These particles can travel millions of miles, and some may eventually collide with the Earth.\n“Most of these particles are deflected away, but some become captured in the Earth’s magnetic field, accelerating down towards the north and south poles into the atmosphere. This is why aurora activity is concentrated at the magnetic poles.”\nRoyal Observatory astronomer, Tom Kerss added: “These particles then slam into atoms and molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere and essentially heat them up.\n“We call this physical process ‘excitation’, but it’s very much like heating a gas and making it glow.”\nThe Northern Lights are usually seen in extreme polar regions (Image: Getty Images)\nThe best places to the Northern Lights\nThe Royal Museums Greenwich said: “The aurora borealis can be seen in the northern hemisphere, while the aurora australis is found in the southern hemisphere.\n“While the best places to see the aurora are concentrated around the polar regions, the aurora borealis can sometimes be seen in the UK.\n“The further north you are the more likely you are to see the display – but heightened solar activity has meant that the northern lights have been seen as far south as Cornwall and Brighton.\n“The conditions do still need to be right however. Dark and clear nights, preferably with little light pollution, offer the best chance of seeing the aurora.”",

If that wasn’t the case there’d be little point in keeping it going.\n\"If Albion Rovers was forced to close, the impact would be felt across the entire community. But I’m sensing that more locals are becoming aware of our plight and are stepping up.”\nThis is where amidst a picture gallery of club heroes like their former manager and ex-Rangers star, Davie Provan.\nRead More: Why whisky tasting was the most Scottish moment in my life\nThere’s a picture of one John Smith, a supporter who was inducted into the Albion Rovers Hall of Fame who began supporting the club during the second world war and was “one of the few supporters to remember the Rovers playing in top flight league football during season 1947-48”.\nThat team of legends included Jock Stein, who made 236 appearances for the Rovers before moving to Llanelli in Wales and then to captain Celtic where he emerged as the most important figure in the history of the Hoops.\nIt’s at this point you have to ask the question: couldn’t Celtic, the richest club in Scotland, spare a few bob to help out this one which is woven into their history.\nGenerations of Coatbridge families have provided support for Celtic. Surely there is still sufficient sentiment amidst their fiduciary corporate responsibilities to help the Rovers in their darkest hours?\nRonnie Boyd gently steers me away from this line of thought and talks about Celtic and Rangers having to be run as businesses in a fiercely competitive market.\nAnd so he introduces me to Chris Ide, the club doctor, who’s been providing this service for 19 seasons and refused to take a penny in return.\nHe’d originally been a Portsmouth supporter and I’m eager to tell him about my guilty (and utterly useless passion) of learning football lists in my youth, including the fact that Portsmouth won back to back league titles in 1949 and 1950 and that, having won the FA Cup in 1939 before the outbreak of war, they’re the longest-ever holders of the trophy.\nIt’s a form of madness, but today I’m overjoyed that at last someone has appreciated it.\n“My functions are mainly now ornamental,” he says. “I make the tea and help with stadium maintenance.”\nAt the back of the bar, there’s a young team discussing their plans for the evening.\nLet me introduce you to Jason Watson, Jack (Shug) Donnelly, Ryan Kelly and Nathan McPherson.\n“There’s nowhere else we’d rather be on a Saturday afternoon,” says Ryan, who like many others around here, has forsaken Celtic’s Hollywood attractions to follow the Rovers.\n“This is where I’ve made friends for life,” says Jason.\n“It’s one of the places where I’m at my happiest and we’ll do everything to help this club get through this.”\nA thorny nest of boardroom politics has brought Albion Rovers to this parlous state.\nRead More: SNP’s departing MSPs represent the worst of us. They won't be missed\nThis is a private limited company and though the overwhelming majority of shareholders have sought to co-opt new members with expertise and ideas to move the club forward they’ve been blocked at every turn by a handful of large shareholders, led by a single individual.\nNo explanations have been forthcoming as they’re not obliged to justify their reasoning. The others can only guess darkly at their motives.\n“More than 100k a year has gone from our budget after we dropped out of the fourth tier of the senior leagues two seasons ago,” says Ronnie.\n“But that’s what we need if we are to continue paying our players and coaching staff.\n\"I don’t know how long we could sustain this club in these circumstances, but I do know this: I can live with us turning amateur if it means I can still watch them playing on that turf.”\nHis colleague, Donnie Lind, whose grandfather attended Rovers’ only Scottish Cup final against Kilmarnock in 1920 (attendance: 95,000) said: “Another problem is that even when we played clubs like Stenhousemuir, they brought a core travelling support of about 150 which makes a significant difference.\n\"Now we’re playing the likes of Stirling University whose travelling support is a few students with Pot Noodles.”\nThey’re immediate hopes may now rest on a planned artificial pitch behind one of the goals which would enable them to charge rental for community use.\n“It’s a race against the clock, though,” says Ronnie Boyd.\nAt 5.49 on Saturday afternoon, Rovers are edging towards a drab 0-0 draw that suits neither team.\nThe playing surface would put many loftier clubs to shame and there have been flashes of skill, not least from Rovers’ big Spanish teenage striker, Bright Prince Okosun, (although I spend the second half urging him to put his considerable physical presence to better use).\nBut what do I know? The big man’s only gone and sent a towering header past the keeper to secure all three points.\nThe stand erupts and I’m happier that I’d ever expected to be at the outcome of a game in the fifth tier of Scottish football in North Lanarkshire.\n“If you come to the Rovers and don’t fall in love with them then there’s something wrong with you,” says Mary Allen.\nShe speaks the truth, because I’m putting my name down for a season ticket.",

The idea of inclusivity is all well and good, but the reality is there are some children who need support over and above what mainstream provides.\n“While all these platitudes are nice - that everybody is equal - the world isn’t like that. We’re supposed to be giving children an education which ties in with their needs and abilities. We should push them to reach their potential, but we shouldn’t do that in a way that’s detrimental to their health and wellbeing.\n“Shoving kids into mainstream school because it’s cheaper is easy.”\nAnother parent said: \"Exclusion is a society-wide issue that can’t be fixed by throwing all the kids in together and hoping that in 20 years there will be an inclusive society.”\nFamilies also shared their anxiety over the incoming £5bn of cuts to welfare being brought forward by the UK Government.\nJoanne Lamond said: \"Too many young people with ASN face a future of increased dependency, not because of their conditions, but due to systemic failures in education, healthcare, and employment support that’s set them up for economic failure.\n“Instead of penalising the most vulnerable, the government must focus on creating inclusive policies that provide genuine opportunities for all.\n\"Loss of income decreases your quality of life and increases the stress for the family, particularly single parent families. As my child isn’t in school, I also have increased costs of them being at home, and trying to provide the activities that support their meagre educational experience.”\n\"I feel abandoned by the state, which has become cruel. These attitudes have permeated into services which are the gatekeepers of support. It’s an incredibly challenging position as a parent to find yourself in”.",

The UVC rays are the strongest but are almost entirely absorbed by the Earth’s ozone layer. It’s the UVA and UVB rays we need to worry about.\n“B is for burns. UVB rays cause redness, skin damage, those sunburns on holidays,” Fraser says. “A is for ageing. UVA rays are there every day.”\n“What I wanted to do was create a company where that was the centre point of the story,” he adds. “And hopefully through education and really great products, people would realise they need to look after their skin preventatively.”\n(Image: Karene Wedekind)\nRead more from Marissa MacWhirter\nIt’s hard not to be impressed by the young entrepreneur. Fraser, of Bearsden, started his first business at just 13 years old selling sweets door to door. As he grew up, he promised himself that he would launch his first company by the time he was 30.\nLast spring, at 29, Fraser’s personal deadline was fast approaching. He had been working in tech marketing for an American company for a few years when he decided it was time to take the plunge. As much as he loved his job, it was all-consuming and he needed to be all in if it was going to work.\n“I was like, right, you’re going to have to hold yourself accountable,” he recalls. “You want to do this, it’s not just going to happen.”\nHis interest in health and well-being, coupled with his love of marketing, was the launchpad. “I felt that in the skincare market, there were a lot of hyperfeminine products,” he says. “There are also a lot of really clinical products and it can be overwhelming with all these chemical names.\n“I felt there was a gap to position something as lifestyle, gender-neutral with more of a masculine edge to it than a feminine edge. And the number one thing that causes skin damage, ageing, and wrinkles is the sun.\n“You can have all of the chemicals, serums, retinols and peptides in the world, but the reality is that it’s the same with diet and the same with fitness. It’s all about preventative measures.”\nThe next problem Fraser sought to solve was just how much of a nightmare some sunscreen formulas can be. Memories of thick white sunscreen smeared across your face on holiday in Spain spring to mind. “The reason that a lot of people don’t wear sunscreen daily is that they feel horrible, they clog your pores, they stain your t-shirt, they give your skin a white cast or they are sticky.\n“I tried every SPF moisturiser I could find and I didn’t like any of them. Could there be a brand that simplified skincare, reducing the complexity of it all? A simple morning and evening routine with the core being UV protection because that is where the damage is coming from?”\nThe result is a pared-back line suitable for sensitive skin. The products are all vegan, cruelty-free, dermatologically tested and made without parabens, sulphates or silicone. There’s the Daily Hydrating Cleanser to be used day and night with hydrating and exfoliating properties. Then there are the Daily AM Energising Serum and the Daily PM Calming Serum. And of course, the Daily Protection Moisturiser. Calming After Sun Gel, Natural Mineral Sunscreen Lotion and Lip Protection Oil with SPF 25 round off the product line.\nThe simple branding with labels in Pantone perfect shades of blue, green and olive gives the bottles that coveted top-shelf appeal. The aesthetics of the brand were something Fraser thought carefully about, even lending to his decision to call the brand dussl.\n“I took a lot of inspiration from business podcasts and books,” he says. “There is this idea of combining different words to create a unique word and then your brand becomes the definition of that word. I loved that.\n“I tried traditional Scottish words or words that meant hydration or skin but it was hard to find something unique – and to own the SEO traffic that sits with it.”\nIt had to be short and easy to remember. Fraser spent hours writing out word combinations trying to find the right fit. “I had sticky notes all over my walls in my office,” he smiles. The result, dussl, is symmetrical, rolls off the tongue and sounds a bit like hustle. It fits perfectly with the idea that simplified skincare is ideal for people on the go.\n“The other thing, which is really random but quite cool, is SSL is a tech protocol,” Fraser adds. “Secure Socket Layer. It’s security, it protects. And sunscreen is protecting your face.”\nLast month, the brand held a special launch event at the designer lifestyle store HOOS on Great Western Road. It gave Fraser the chance to meet customers face to face and share his infectious enthusiasm for his new brand. “I chatted to anyone who would listen to me,” he says. “We pretty much sold out three lines of products right away: the cleanser, the SPF 50 moisturiser and the lip oil.”\nAnd yes, plenty of people wanted to know why they needed SPF in Glasgow. “I would chat them through it, and as soon as I would talk them through the UV rays they would say, that’s really cool I didn’t understand that. The positivity overall was amazing.”\nAs part of his dedication to skin health, Fraser has made it a priority to partner with skin cancer charities, donating 1 per cent of all dussl revenue to Melanoma UK.\n“Skin health is part of our overall health and wellbeing. You have your diet, your exercise, your nutrition. But your skin is your biggest organ, that’s what faces the world.”\nTo find out more, visit www.dussl.com.\nMarissa MacWhirter is the editor of The Glasgow Wrap.

So I think I probably had a bit of an existential crisis.\n\"Everybody had other things going, our bass player Dom was the creative director in an advertising agency, Al the drummer is a post-production guy in film and TV, Shahen the accordion player is a civil servant in the Home Office and, obviously, Tim Dowling is a columnist on The Guardian – so we’re quite an eclectic bunch.\n\"You don’t have to make a living from it, which is the good thing. We don’t lose money doing it, we do this on a professional basis and consider ourselves professional but without relying on it to make a living.\n“So we approach it with a degree or seriousness and professionalism without, I hope, taking ourselves too seriously – which would be ridiculous at our age.\n\"We’ve been described as pop music with all the wrong instruments – accordion, banjo, fiddle, mandolin, trumpet, bass, drums and acoustic guitar – so sonically it’s an Americana roots landscape but lyrically and sensibility-wise very British. Not just English, we have several Scottish songs with Scottish subject matter.\n“We’re concerned with our real lives in this isles as opposed to looking to America and singing songs about Tennessee and railroads.\n“The touring has been very central to the whole thing from the very beginning because it was the only way of finding out whether what we were doing was any good or not.\n“We weren’t expecting that aspect of what we do to be the thing people liked, but it turns out it’s the thing that people overwhelmingly like about us, much to our surprise. Someone described us as a ‘seven-headed joy machine’ and I’ll have that!\"\nPolice Dog Hogan play SWG3 in Glasgow on April 4 and The Voodoo Rooms in Edinburgh on April 5.

      "content_en": "As of March 2023 there were 1,037 care homes for adults in Scotland of which 792 (76%) were for older people, 146 (14%) were for learning disabilities, 52 (5%) were for mental health problems, and 33 (3%) were for physical and sensory impairment.\nOver 40,000 people in Scotland live in care homes, of which 92% are resident in care homes for older people.\nThat figure is only likely to increase in the coming years, with 20% of Scotland's population now over 65.\nRead More:\nSince October 2016, the Scottish Government and local authorities have committed to paying adult social care workers the national living wage during waking hours, with this provision expanded in 2018-19 to include those undertaking sleepovers.\nThe latest Scottish Government budget reaffirms this commitment, with the UK Government having increased the national living wage to £12.21 per hour from April 2025, and Holyrood has provided funding for local authorities to increase the rate paid to carers to £12.60.\nThe move was initially welcomed, providing care staff in Scotland with a 'premium' compared to the rest of the UK.\nHowever, new analysis undertaken by the STUC has found that the estimated 64,000 residential care workers in Scotland are now earning less on average than their counterparts in the rest of the UK.\n(Image: STUC) A report found residential care worker pay in Scotland is now 11p lower than it is in the rest of the UK, having been 38 pence an hour higher just five years ago. In 2020, residential care workers in Scotland were paid 4% more than the typical UK care worker, but by 2024 they earned 1% less.\nResidential care worker pay in Scotland has increased by £2.27 over that period but that is less than the increase in the minimum wage (£2.72), average earnings (£3.44) and carer pay in the rest of the UK (£2.76).\nBecause pay is tied to the national living wage, a greater increase in the minimum wage compared to that measure penalises those in the care sector in relative terms.\nFrom April 2020 to April 2024 the median pay for residential care workers in Scotland rose by 21.6% but the minimum wage increased by 31.2% while median pay for carers elsewhere in the UK rose by 27.2%.\nIn 2020, residential care workers were paid 20% more than the UK minimum wage, by 2024, this had fallen to 12%, meaning any 'wage premium' carers receive is being eroded.\n(Image: STUC) The impact of inflation has also hit the sector hard.\nAccording to the STUC data, in the last five years residential care workers have seen a real-terms pay cut of 2.1% using CPI (consumer price index) inflation and 9.6% using RPI (retail price index).\nThe report concludes: \"The Scottish Government’s policy of increasing pay in the social care sector in line with the real living wage is no longer fit for purpose.\n\"Residential care worker pay is being left behind by the minimum wage, inflation, average earnings in the rest of the economy, and residential care worker pay in the rest of the UK. Unchecked, these trends will only serve to exacerbate the crisis in Scotland’s social care system, with knock-on impacts on delayed discharge from hospitals.\"\nThe STUC is calling on the Scottish Government to increase pay in social care to £15 per hour, introduce sectoral bargaining - in which agreements would by negotiated on behalf of and apply to the whole sector - and, in the mean time, increase pay in line with or above percentage increases in average earnings, the minimum wage, and residential care worker pay in the rest of the UK.\nSandra, a care worker, told The Herald: \"One of the things that could sort it out is sectoral bargaining, so that everyone who works in social care has the same terms and conditions.\n“We’re all providing local authorities with services, they pay for the contracts, so we should all have the same annual leave, the same pay - but it’s not that way.\"\nIncreasing levels of privatisation are also impacting care workers.\nA 2021 report produced by GMB found that, on average, pay was £1.60 lower in the private sector than the public sector.\n(Image: Getty) A study released late last year by Public Health Scotland found a 20% decrease in the number of people in local authority or health board care homes for older people between 2013 and 2023, with 76% of homes now run by the private sector.\nAgency worker Tamara told The Herald: \"I work predominantly in private care but when I do shifts in the local authority homes I do find the staff are happier and there are more of them.\n“The local authorities are held more accountable by the Scottish Government than the private care sector is, because those homes are obviously just run for profit.\n“Local authorities get funding from the government so they’re held more to account whereas the private ones don’t rely on that as much so they don’t face the same kind of accountability.\n“There are also better training opportunities and better equipment, I find that things are better and more smoothly run.”\nIssues within the private sector have been highlighted by trades unions for some time.\nIn 2021, a GMB survey found that nearly three quarters of care home workers felt that they did not have enough time to deliver safe and dignified care.\nThis is borne out in a new STUC report which uses Care Inspectorate data to examine differences in staffing resources across private, voluntary and public sector care homes for older people.\nIt found staffing levels were 20% lower in private care homes than in the public sector or voluntary sector.\nThe data compared the number of registered places in a care home to the number of full-time staff.\nOn average, private sector care homes had 1.3 places for each staff member, compared to 1.08 in not-for-profit care homes.\nThe STUC said: \"Staffing ratios in residential care homes matter. They matter for patient care, for health and safety, and for staff wellbeing. This report shows that staffing resources in private care homes are significantly lower than in public and voluntary care homes.\n\"Yet to date, Scottish Government proposals for reform of the care sector have not given any attention to different staffing ratios in the private, voluntary and public sector.\n\"Given the plethora of evidence that the not-for-profit sector has better staffing ratios, less complaints, and higher pay, any meaningful reform to improve social care must propose substantive changes to who actually provides care.\"\nConcerns have also been raised about the potential impact of Britain's decision to leave the European Union on the provision of health and social care.\nA 2022 report by the Scottish Government found that around 6.2% of staff in adult care homes were from the EU, a total of 3290.\nWhile there had been no statistically significant decrease in this number since the Brexit vote, of those studied 75% said it had become more difficult in the wake of leaving the European Union to recruit staff for care homes, while 30% said EU staff had left in the previous 12 months.\nDecreases in immigration present a demographic problem for Scotland, which has the lowest population growth in the UK, with the 2.7% increase in the last census driven entirely by inward migration.\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said: “We value the vital role social care workers play in delivering high-quality care to people of Scotland.\n“We also remain deeply concerned about the impact the increase in Employers National Insurance Contributions (ENICs) will have across the social care sector.\n“Our 2025/26 budget provides an additional £125 million to enable adult social care workers, delivering direct care in commissioned services, to be paid at least £12.60 an hour, in line with the Real Living Wage. This £125m takes our total investment in improving social care pay to £950 million.\n“This is higher than the National Living Wages which applies to many social care workers in England and Northern Ireland.”",

      "content_en": "In January the Scottish Government shelved plans for a 'national care service' which would have brought structural reforms to the way in which adult social care is delivered.\nThe plans, first put forward in 2021, would have made social care the responsibility of the Scottish Government rather than local authorities which then health and social care minister Humza Yousaf said would \"end the postcode lottery of care in Scotland\".\nRead More:\nThe plans would have seen services commissioned nationally through regional care boards, under ministerial direction, as well as the creation of a national social work agency to oversee social work education, professional development, improvement, workforce planning and terms and conditions.\nThe scheme faced significant opposition, however, losing the support of COSLA and the STUC, with concerns it failed to address key issues such as pay and took decision making powers away from local authorities.\nAs revealed in The Herald on Sunday, residential carers in Scotland are now earning less, on average, than their counterparts in the rest of the UK.\nCare home pay in Scotland is linked to the national living wage, but unions have warned that model is no longer fit for purpose with that measure failing to grow as quickly as real wages, minimum wage and inflation.\nHourly pay will rise to £12.60 in 2025, above the national living wage of £12.21, but the STUC is calling on Holyrood to guarantee £15 to prevent care workers falling further behind.\nThe body said: \"The Scottish Government’s policy of increasing pay in the social care sector in line with the real living wage is no longer fit for purpose. Residential care worker pay is being left behind by the minimum wage, inflation, average earnings in the rest of the economy, and residential care worker pay in the rest of the UK. Unchecked, these trends will only serve to exacerbate the crisis in Scotland’s social care system, with knock-on impacts on delayed discharge from hospitals.\n\"To address these issues the Scottish Government should restore five years of pay erosion by increasing pay in social care to £15 an hour; Introduce sectoral bargaining in social care, a recommendation first proposed by the Fair Work Convention in 2019, but not yet acted on by the Scottish Government; until sectoral bargaining is established, introduce a triple lock on social care worker pay – increasing pay in line with or above percentage increases in average earnings, the minimum wage, and residential care worker pay in the rest of the UK; safeguard and extend public sector provision, which has fallen in the last 10 years.\"\nWriting in The Herald on Sunday, STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said: \"We’ve listened to the promises of the Scottish Government: from their championed but ultimately doomed National Care Service Bill to their pledges to get our care workers to £15 per hour. Ultimately, neither has materialised and it is having a crippling impact on our workforce.\n\"Residential care workers have suffered a severe 9.6% real terms pay cut in the last five years with their pay 27% less than the average worker. Our research further reveals that care workers in Scotland would be £944 a year better off had residential care worker pay in Scotland tracked pay in the rest of the UK over the last five years.\n\"Far from being underpaid, care workers are being undercut and having their pay stripped away from their bare hands.\"\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said: “We value the vital role social care workers play in delivering high-quality care to people of Scotland.\n“We also remain deeply concerned about the impact the increase in Employers National Insurance Contributions (ENICs) will have across the social care sector.\n“Our 2025/26 budget provides an additional £125 million to enable adult social care workers, delivering direct care in commissioned services, to be paid at least £12.60 an hour, in line with the Real Living Wage.

      "content_en": "The decline represents a significant challenge for universities, which rely on tuition fees from international students and undergraduate and postgraduate levels to sustain their operations. International student fees vary by programme and university, but some are £50,000 per year or more.\nAccording to the most recent data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), there were 10,060 fewer international higher education students at Scottish universities than the year before and 10,785 fewer students overall.\nIn 2023/2024, 73,915 non-UK students accounted for 26% of the total HE students in Scotland (281,455).\nThe year before, there were 83,975 non-UK students out of 292,240 students overall (28%).\nStatistics show that the most significant decline in international students was among taught postgradute courses, which recorded 7,960 fewer non-UK students compared to 2022/2023.\nScottish universities \"dangerously reliant\" on international fees\nWhen student statistics for the 2022/2023 academic year were published last autumn, the data showed a slight increase in international students to a record-high of over 83,000.\nHowever, official enrolment statistics are often a year or more old when released. University leaders quickly warned that these numbers were outdated and did not reflect the full impacts of recent UK Government immigration policy changes and global economic and political crises.\nClaire McPherson, director of Universities Scotland, said the newest data, published this week, justifies those concerns and \"catches up with the reality that universities have experienced over the last 18 months.\"\nShe added that the \"sudden, sharp fall\" in postgraduate taught students (down 25% on average across Scotland) \"has flipped the pattern of five years of growth of enrolments on its head\".\n“It is both the scale and the suddenness of the fall that has been incredibly challenging for many institutions to manage. Scotland’s model of funding Scottish students and university research has become dangerously reliant on cross-subsidy from international students over the last decade because of chronic underfunding.\n\"That puts institutions in a hugely exposed position, as today’s official statistics show for the sector, and for some institutions more acutely than others. This week, the Permanent Secretary confirmed that university finances are high up on the Scottish Government’s risk register.\n\"There is a very pressing need for a different kind of strategic conversation with the Scottish Government about short-term stability and long-term solutions for the sustainability of our universities.\"\nDifferent realities at different institutions\nUniversities rely on international students' fees to cover the costs of teaching, and they have become increasingly necessary for cross-subsidising the costs of teaching Scottish students.\nA recent Herald investigation found that Scottish Government funding for Scottish students covers less than half of the costs of teaching some subjects.\nHowever, as Ms McPherson explained, every university has a different relationship with international students as part of its enrolment total and with individual recruitment markets.\n“The sector average fall of 25% (among international postgraduate taught students) conceals even sharper falls for some institutions, depending on the range of countries they recruit from.\n\"Demand from India and Nigeria has fallen, whereas demand from China and North America has remained relatively stable.\"\nRead more:\nIn 2024, the universities with the highest percentage of international students were the Universities of St Andrews (47%), Edinburgh (42%), Herriot-Watt (38%), and Glasgow (34%).\nThe lowest percentages were at the Open University (0%), Scotland's Rural College (1%), the University of the Highlands and Islands (3%), Abertay University (11%) and Queen Margaret University (19%).\nIn addition to having different makeups, each university was affected differently by the most recent decline in international students.\nIn 2023, international students made up 29% of Robert Gordon University's total, but that fell to 16% in 2024.\nThe Universities of Dundee and Aberdeen saw drops of around 4%, while St Andrews remained stable.\nEach percentage point represents potentially thousands of pounds\nBecause international tuition fees are much higher than what the Scottish Government provides for home students, changes in international student enrolment significantly impact university finances.\nHESA will not publish updated financial data for Scotland's universities until later in the Spring. Still, the most recent information indicates some of the country's universities rely on international tuition for more than a third of their total income. On average, international tuition represents 22% of Scottish HE income across the sector.\nBecause of the disproportionate reliance on international fees, individual universities will be hit harder by the recent decline in international students.\nAt Dundee University, for example, the institution is facing an urgent cash crisis. It recently received £22 million from the Scottish Government to allow time for implementing a larger recovery plan, which could include cuts of more than 600 jobs.\nAccording to HESA data, the number of international students at Dundee fell from 4,570 in 2023 to 3,335 in 2024. Again, the majority of these losses were at the postgraduate taught level, which, in many cases, includes prospective students from demographics more likely to be impacted by the UK's more restrictive visa and immigration policies which came into play.\nAlthough there are separate questions about potential mismanagement and errors in governance that may have amplified Dundee University's financial challenges, the new HESA data reinforces concerns that the sector as a whole is facing a financial crisis.\nAre there any possible solutions?\nStakeholders have been calling for changes to the funding model for higher and further education, in part to help universities end their reliance on international fees.\nThese discussions often devolve into a question of whether the Scottish Government should continue with its policy of free tuition for Scottish students attending home universities. This policy is made possible by the government's payment of a standard £1,820 fee and additional funding per student depending on their subject.\nThis line of questioning has proven to be a non-starter for the government. In the face of questions about the potential collapse of Dundee University, Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth recently confirmed that the government will not change its stance on free tuition.\nUniversity leaders have previously said that this conversation does not address the full extent of the problem, however.\nAs The Herald's investigation showed, government funding only covers an average of 58% of the costs of teaching any given subject.\nThis suggests that the larger question is less about who pays the tuition and more about how high the bill should be.",

      "content_en": "Visitors to these places can typically explore a whole host of fascinating exhibits designed to inform, entertain, and educate, and the goal is obvious: offer exciting, child-led exposure, built around a sense of wonder, and hope that this sparks an interest in – and maybe even a love of – science, technology and learning.\nBut most centres go further than that, even if people don’t always know about it, and the one housed in a purpose-built facility by Glasgow’s Clydeside is no different.\nThe Community Learning Team at Glasgow Science Centre works with a range of different organisations representing and supporting an enormously diverse selection of people. The educational experiences that they offer include interactive activities, workshops, public events and portable, pop-up exhibits, all designed to break down barriers to STEM specifically, and learning more generally, while also supporting personal development and community integration.\nIn recent years this has meant developing programmes for those from low-income households, disabled people, the elderly, young carers, LGBTQ+ groups, those with additional support needs, people for whom English is not their first language, specific men’s and women’s groups, and much more. Organisations including Interfaith Glasgow, Govan Men’s Shed, African Challenge, the Prince’s Trust, Glasgow Disability Alliance, Alzheimer Scotland, and City of Glasgow College have all worked with the Community Learning Team at Glasgow Science Centre to help enhance the services and support on offer to their clients and service users.\nThe Bothy in Glasgow Science Centre (Image: Glasgow Science Centre) When they are not taking mobile exhibits on tour around the city, or the country, much of the team’s education work takes place in The Bothy, a dedicated learning space that was installed during the enforced closures of the Covid pandemic. It is an open, welcoming space that offers the facilities of a modern classroom but in a less intimidating environment – a crucial consideration when a great deal of the target audience are already having to overcome personal and social barriers in order to take part in one of the courses on offer.\nIn recent weeks, the team has delivered a programme called Adding Value, a numeracy skills course, to a group of women for whom English is not their first language. Established with help from AMINA, the Muslim Women’s Resource Centre, the class helps adults develop confidence with numbers while also expanding their language skills. Lessons were delivered in English, but translation services were also made available, with the hope that students would become less dependent on this provision as they became more comfortable not just with the content, but with one another.\nThe course itself was fully certified and offered at SCQF level 3, which is roughly equivalent to an old Foundation Standard Grade. It was also internally assessed, meaning that students did not need to face a high-stakes, high-stress final exam, but still received formal recognition of their learning that can support progression to the next level of study in a setting such as a college.\nAlicia Robertson, Sheena McDonald and Amy Childs from the Community Learning Team at Glasgow Science Centre (Image: Steven Angus / Glasgow Science Centre)\nFor some of those taking part, the programme was an opportunity to enhance their numeracy skills with a view to accessing further education, or returning to courses that had previously proven too challenging due to the level of maths involved. Many others were motivated largely by the desire to help their children with school work that, due to language issues and different teaching approaches in their home countries, they might struggle to understand.\nBut some have a very different story: one student had an accounting degree from her home country and found that working through a course like this one, where the subject matter was very familiar, made it easier to improve her English skills.\nSimilar stories have emerged from earlier iterations of the programme, with participants having previously dropped out of education, or struggled to even access it in the first place. Sometimes poor numeracy skills were the main barrier, but more often than not the real roadblock was confidence, and in those cases courses like Adding Value can be in invaluable in opening the door to new opportunities.\nIn the best case scenarios, programmes like these can even be the starting point for a better life.\nFor more information on courses available from the Glasgow Science Centre, visit their website.

      "content_en": "Now a group of school girls hopes to change all that. Inspired by her example, the pupils, who attend Inverkeithing High School, have launched a campaign to call their new, Rosyth-based secondary school Janet McCallum High.\nNot only has their proposal made it onto a four-strong shortlist, their efforts have led to a dramatic new discovery: a medal given to McCallum to mark her incarceration.\n“When we heard about the consultation, we looked at the high schools across Fife and noticed a huge lack of diversity, with four — Bell Baxter, Waid, St Columba’s and St Andrew’s — named after men, and only one — Queen Anne — after a woman,” the group, who are campaigning anonymously, explained. “We wanted to find a positive local hero pupils will be able to look up to.”\nThe girls stumbled on McCallum through the work of Protests and Suffragettes: a team of artists and activists working to reclaim the histories of women activists in Scotland. McCallum was born in Dunfermline, grew up in Inverkeithing, and later led the 1919 Rosyth rent strike, so is intimately linked with the area.\nApproached by the pupils, volunteers at Protests and Suffragettes redoubled their efforts to research McCallum’s life, delving into archives and contacting relatives until - last week - they were handed photographs of the award by McCallum’s Edinburgh-based great niece, Sheila Perry.\nAn article in The Vote magazine from 1910 which lists “Miss Jenny McCallum” as marching (Image: Protests and Suffragettes)\nSimilar medals were handed out by the Emmeline Pankhurst-founded Women’s Social and Political Union to suffragettes who had been imprisoned, particularly those who had been on hunger strike. But by 1908 — the year of the protest — McCallum had left the WSPU and joined the Women’s Freedom League (WFL), a rival organisation set up in response to the Pankhursts’ increasingly autocratic leadership style.\nMcCallum’s medal, which depicts the front gates of Holloway and is engraved with date of her imprisonment — October 28 — was given to her by the WFL, and so is rarer.\n“This may be among the very first medals awarded to any suffragette by the WFL, which is exciting,” said Jill McKean, a volunteer with protests and Suffragettes and Blue Badge Tourist Guide with Scottish Highland Trails.\nRead more from Dani Garavelli:\nPerry, a history graduate who writes novels, was sent the photograph by relatives in South Africa where McCallum, her husband, Harry, who had worked in the Rosyth dockyard, and their three children emigrated in the 1920s.\n“I have always known about Jenny: that she was an activist, that she had red hair, which you can’t see in the photographs, but was a McCallum thing,” Perry said. “Jenny was friends with lots of Labour activists, and there is a family story that my mother [McCallum’s niece] was dandled as a baby on James Maxton’s knee while visiting Jenny in Rosyth.\n“I didn’t know much about what happened to the family after they went to South Africa, but a few days ago, a descendant of her daughter sent me photographs of both her passport and the medal, which I didn’t even know existed.”\nOn the day of the London protest, a group of suffragettes in the ladies gallery of the House of Commons, with its brass lattice screen, began shouting: “We have listened behind the grille long enough. The women of England demand the vote.” Meanwhile, according to one newspaper, in the Old Palace Yard, “four very athletic suffragettes [including McCallum] clambered on a statue”.\nCourt reports described McCallum as \"a little Scotch girl with a decided accent\" and mocked her appearance.\n“Scottish suffragettes don’t get much attention,” Perry said. “So I would be over the moon if the school was to be named after Jenny. She should be better known in her own locality.”\nThe Inverkeithing pupils are following in McCallum’s tradition with a spontaneous, grassroots campaign, which has involved not only carrying out their own research but lobbying the councillors.\n“We found out that, throughout 1907, [Jenny] helped organise a ‘Great Demonstration’, a [Fife] event that involved open air meetings and was attended by Christabel Pankhurst,” the campaigners said. “Later, with the WFL, she organised teatime meetings for working class suffragettes and campaigned against the oppression of all working class people.”\nShe must have kept in touch with the Pankhursts, too, as during the rent strikes she brought Sylvia to represent the tenants in court.\nCouncillor David Barratt, convenor of the South West Fife area committee, said: “We were looking for something meaningful — that Schooly McSchool Face was never going to cut it. This group of girls got in touch to say they would like to present their research to us. They were so engaged, it was really impressive.”\nA rare medal from Holloway has been discovered (Image: Protests and Suffragettes)\nIn the end, the council received hundreds of proposals, with more than 7,000 votes cast in an exercise to whittle them down. The shortlist was supposed to be three, but Barratt used his powers as convenor to extend it to four so Janet McCallum High could be included.\nThe other names to make the shortlist are Caledonia, which topped the poll, Rosyth and Forth. The £88m school, expected to open in August 2026, includes a steel representation of the Forth Bridge incorporated into its structure.\n“These were all popular proposals, but I wanted to accommodate the name put forward by the pupils, given it is their school, and also to help them to continue to raise awareness of Janet McCallum,” Barratt said.\nThe deadline for voting is 5pm on March 28. The girls said: “Janet was a very important figure in our community and deserves to be remembered and honoured for her amazing work in trying to make the world a better place.”\n“Whatever happens next the girls have done Janet proud,” Barratt added.",

      "content_en": "Writing for The Herald on Sunday, Anat Kraskin, the co-president of the Jewish Society, said a recent video by the Glasgow University Justice for Palestine Society (GUJPS) had left Jewish students \"expressing fear, distress, and disbelief\".\nProtests have ramped up in recent days, following Israel's renewed offensive in Gaza.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, ordered a series of aerial attacks in the Palestinian territory, bringing to an end the fragile truce that has been in place since January.\nIt followed the collapse of talks over the release of hostages.\nThe strikes have killed hundreds, according to the Gazan Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants.\nREAD MORE\nOn Thursday around 100 students formed a blockade on University Avenue, the main road running through the West End campus.\nStudents also briefly took over the Charles Wilson building, ending their occupation in part because of police presence and after securing a commitment for a meeting with University Secretary David Duncan.\nThree students from GUJPS started a hunger strike on Wednesday — they have since been joined by three others.\nThey took to Instagram to set out a list of demands, including calls for the university to divest from the arms trade, the cutting of research ties with arms companies, and “no repercussions for activists” taking part in the protest.\nThey also called for the university to “ban arms companies and Zionists from our campus\".\nThe video then ended with the three shouting “long live the intifada\".\nMs Kraskin argues that when GUJPS talk about Zionists, they are talking about Jews.\nShe said: “When the overwhelming majority of Jewish people describe themselves as Zionists — polling often suggests over 80% of my community — then calling for their erasure is clearly antisemitic.\n“Indeed, while not the same, there is an undeniable connection between Jewish people and Israel. It is why Jewish people have prayed facing Jerusalem for millennia. Zionism is simply the belief that Jewish people have a right to a state in their ancestral homeland.”\nShe added: “Instead of openly targeting Jews, the focus has shifted to targeting Zionism, knowing full well that Zionism is inseparable from Jewish identity for the vast majority of Jews. It is a strategy designed to make antisemitism socially acceptable, but the intent remains unchanged.”\nMs Kraskin said the use of the phrase “long live intifada” was a “call for violence against Jewish people and to support the murder of Jews\".\n“This warrants expulsion from Glasgow University,” she added. “I would like to think that if any student expressed support for violence against any religious group on campus, they would be immediately expelled. Why does that standard never seem to apply to those expressing antisemitism?”\nThe term \"intifada\" is an Arabic word meaning \"uprising\" or \"shaking off,\" but in this context it refers to Palestinian uprisings against Israel.\nThe First Intifada between 1987 and 1993 began as a largely non-violent movement, involving protests, strikes, and civil disobedience, but escalated into violence over time.\nThe Second Intifada, however, was marked by significant violence, including suicide bombings, resulting in the deaths of 1,000 Israelis and 3,000 Palestinians.\nMs Kraskin also hit out at the Rector of the university, Dr Ghassan Abu-Sittah, a British-Palestinian plastic and reconstructive surgeon.\nHe won 80% of the student vote at the election last year. During his campaign he said he would seek to change the definition of antisemitism used by the University.\nIn 2021, the University adopted the definition which states that antisemitism is a “certain perception of Jews that may be expressed as hatred” toward them.\nIt also includes a series of examples of antisemitism including holding Israel to a “double standard” and claiming Israel’s existence is a “racist endeavour\".\nIn his manifesto, Dr Abu-Sittah said he believed the definition risked \"undermining freedom of speech and intellectual thought on campus” and that he would call for it to be replaced.\nIn her column, Ms Kraskin wrote: “Antisemitism in the UK is at some of the highest recorded levels, and Scottish universities have not been immune.\n\"Polling by the Community Security Trust suggests that antisemitism at British universities has risen by 117% over the past two years, continuing an already worrying trend.\n“Jewish students are not only fearful, but worse, we feel that our fears are being ignored, dismissed, or outright denied.\n“These feelings were most acutely felt following the election of the now Glasgow University Rector, who built his whole campaign around removing the IHRA definition, the most widely accepted definition of antisemitism, a definition endorsed by the overwhelming majority of representatives of Jewish communities around the world.“\nShe also criticised the Rector for giving the eulogy at the funeral of Maher Al-Yemani, the co-founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a proscribed terrorist group in the UK.\nMs Kraskin wrote: “A university should be a space for diverse opinions, but it cannot be a space for threats, intimidation, and incitement to violence.\n“When antisemitism is excused or tolerated under the false banner of political activism, the message is clear: Jewish students are not equally protected. They are expected to endure hostility that would be deemed unacceptable if directed at any other minority group.\n“Despite these challenges, I'm proud to say that we, Jewish students, have only grown stronger and more united. We continue to advocate for our rights, to challenge antisemitism, and to stand firm against hatred in all its forms.\n“However, our voices alone are not enough. We need the support of University administrations, political leaders, and the wider community to ensure that Jewish students, like all students, can pursue their education free from discrimination and harassment.”\nA spokesperson for the University of Glasgow said it recognised the concerns and took the complaints “extremely seriously\".\nThey added that any student believed to have used language which breached their Code of Conduct, would face disciplinary action, and any suspected hate crime would be reported to the police.\nThey also made clear that the Rector is not a member of the senior management group and his views, and those of student societies, do not represent those of the University.\nThe spokesperson said: \"The University’s priority is the safety and wellbeing of our students and colleagues, and we stand opposed to hate and harassment in any form.\n“The University fully recognises the concerns of Jewish students. Senior managers are in regular contact with the University’s Jewish Society as well as with leaders of the Jewish community in Scotland.\n\"We take complaints received about recent protests on campus extremely seriously. The University has contacted protesting groups, and everyone across our community, challenging in particular the use of language which is likely to cause harm and distress.\n\"As a University we have sought to tackle antisemitism, Islamophobia or any other form of racism on campus. In particular, we engaged extensively with the office of Lord Mann as he undertook an inquiry into Jewish student experiences in Higher Education and Glasgow’s work to address antisemitism is referenced throughout Lord Mann’s report.\"\nA spokerson for GUJPS said: \"As Kraskin acknowledges, Jewish identity and the modern nation-state of Israel — founded through the displacement and violent ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in 1948 (known as the Nabka) and maintained through the structural enforcement of apartheid and genocide to this day (as argued before the ICJ by South Africa) — are not one and the same.\n\"Her theological argument that the connection between Jews and Israel is 'undeniable' holds no water as the basis of a modern political concept such as the nation-state, which did not develop until the mid-17th century with the establishment of the English Commonwealth, by the earliest estimations.\n\"After all, Al-Aqsa mosque and many Christian sites of great importance lie within Palestine —this does not give any one religious or ethnic group the right to reinterpret liturgical passages and religious rites as the basis for political domination and oppression, which we clearly see the Israeli state do on a daily basis — from the indescribable brutality of the bombing of Gaza, to the daily surveillance, terrorisation, and dehumanisation of Palestinians in the West Bank, occupied Palestine, and around the world.\n\"Thus, Zionism is not 'simply the belief that Jewish people have the right to a state in their ancestral homeland,' it is a racist form of ethno-nationalism; there is nothing 'simple' about a 'homeland' that is established through atrocity and the displacement of those already living in Palestine: Palestinians.\"\nThey added: \"The Jewish members of GUJPS also wish to express that political Zionism erases and voids the rich history and cultural contributions of Jews living within the UK and across the world, who do not define their identity through the state of Israel.\"\nThey said the demand to ban Zionists from campus, was \"in direct response to the repeated invitation of prominent pro-Israeli speakers, such as Michael Gove and Kerissa Khan to campus by the university, as well as companies which facilitate and profit off of Israel’s genocide, such as BAE Systems and CGI.\"\nThey said the the interpretation of the Arabic word intifada as a call to violence against Jews is \"dangerously ignorant of the word’s actual meaning of ‘shaking off’ or ‘rising up,’ and its use to describe the historical periods in which Palestinians have resisted their colonial domination and oppression by Israel.\"",

      "content_en": "Yet there I was on a Monday night earlier this month lying on a trolley bed in a corridor somewhere in Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth unable to sleep through the pain and discomfort.\nWhat seemed to start off as an annoying sinus infection turned out to be quite a significant bout of pneumonia in both my lungs.\nNot ideal to say the least but this is not a personal sob story.\nThe experience allowed an insight into the current care and waits in Scotland’s NHS.\nFrom my own care path to fellow patients’, what I found was deeply troubling.\nMy route into the belly of the beast began at a local practice.\nAfter a third trip to the GP, I was sent to ‘Glasgow’s super hospital’ and told to head for what the doctor named, ‘The Immediate Assessment Unit’.\nIt turns out this was not very immediate and it is instead called ‘Intermediate’- IAU for short. This is the route patients take when they are referred to the hospital by their GPs.\nThis was meant to provide a speedier route to care than an A & E path, according to my GP, but after experiencing both IAU and A&E waits, I’d beg to differ.\nThe waiting room is small, dark and crowded. Everyone is in a lot of pain. One man faints beside me.\nI arrive at 1.30pm and I am eventually diagnosed by a doctor and given medication at 10pm that day.\nThe waits didn’t stop there. I’m informed shortly after that I’d be sleeping in a corridor that night.\n“It’s really sh** and I’m so sorry for that,” a kind consultant candidly tells me.\nI see her dart about, making the same genuine apologies to others but it’s not her fault. This doctor is doing her best under a system that is beyond breaking point.\nDespite junior doctors desperately vying for jobs across the country, they are like gold dust here.\nIt’s the same with qualified nurses. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called the situation “ludicrous” as he told me this week he’s spoken to relatives of qualified nurses unable to find employment.\nThis rings true with what NHS staff said during my time in hospital.\nThe problem isn’t that no-one wants to do the job, it’s that there aren’t enough jobs, a consultant in the QEUH remarks.\nEducators have since told me they are worried about the future jobs opportunities for their students.\nThen there’s the glaringly obvious capacity issue.\nA doctor says they built the QEUH with roughly 1,000 less beds than it should have.\nAnother apology ensues. “We need more staff and we need more beds”, he simply puts it.\nWhat many may not know about corridor care but could very likely guess is that assessments and treatments in these zones are almost non-existent.\nIt’s a public space. Any assessments must happen behind a curtain or a private room.\nNow, I’m lucky. I’m in my late twenties and I’m not often ill. I can walk to the toilet and I don’t have other complex medical needs.\nHowever, looking around the narrow, busy space, the five other trolleys are all occupied by elderly patients. Many immobile.\nThe man in front of me is 89. My corridor buddy clearly has delirium. At 3am, he tries to steal my oxygen mask. I manage to stop him by moaning loudly for a good 30 seconds.\nAll was forgiven as backing away, the 89-year-old plops himself on his trolley and begins singing Viva Las Vegas. If you don’t laugh, you’ll cry.\nBut then there’s an upsetting aspect of his NHS journey.\nThe elderly man tries to go to the toilet on several occasions but staff won’t let him as he needs assistance. ‘He’s known for running away’, apparently.\nMy corridor buddy clearly has delirium. At 3am, he tries to steal my oxygen mask.\nBecause staff are rushed off their feet, it takes half an hour (I counted) for someone to come round and help him.\nThen there's the older woman behind me who is at high risk of having a stroke.\nAll the care she can get in her trolley is the same as mine: an oxygen tank and the occasional check-in to see if she needs painkillers. She has to wait the whole night with her daughter anxiously holding her hand.\nIn corridor care in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. (Image: staff) Despite her own health problems, her approach is incredibly similar to my late gran's stern words but kind concern.\n“That’s an awful cough you’ve got, dear. Mind and take loads of water,” she says as I pass her by following a trip to the toilet.\nWe chat for a bit and I ask her how she’s doing. She tells me she will be fine - that familiar brand of Glaswegian stoicism seeping through - but I know she’s worried. Who wouldn’t be?\nREAD MORE:\nAt the same time we were in hospital, journalists were reporting on the healthcare ordeal of 87-year-old Winifred Bolland from East Lothian.\nThe poor woman was left traumatised after waiting around 12 hours at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary’s A&E department on three separate occasions.\nHer daughter told the press her mother was “badly let down” and she couldn’t possibly survive another admission like that.\nThese stories of pain and waiting amongst the elderly and others are not rare.\nMore than 12,000 patients over the age of 85 were forced to wait in A&E for more than 12 hours last year, according to figures published by the Scottish Liberal Democrats.\nAcross all ages, data analysis by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine found the number of Scots going through the same waits surged to almost 100 times the level it was at in 2011.\nThen there’s the stark figure of a record 10,000 people who have died whilst on Scotland’s NHS waiting lists in the last year. It is understood this is likely an underestimate due to how data is collected by individual health boards.\nIn the first full week of March, there were 9,399 patients who spent longer than four hours in accident and emergency before being either admitted, transferred or discharged.\nThis includes 3,250 patients (12.1%) who were there for at least eight hours and 1,361 (5%) who were there for half a day or more.\nAlthough the recent weekly A&E waiting times show a slight increase in patients being seen, the First Minister himself admits that the waits are unacceptable.\nDespite promises that it is tackling the lists by investing £200 million, the Scottish Government is still well below meeting its target of 95% of patients in A&E admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.\nI respect John Swinney’s honesty when he admits that some patients are not getting the right care at the right time, however, acceptance is not the final stage to be reached when it comes to Scotland’s broken NHS.\nAfter nearly a week in hospital, I’m scared of the place - and I’m deeply concerned that not enough progress is being made.\nOvercapacity and waiting issues are casting a dark cloud over a health service meant to freely serve us from cradle to grave.\nTackling problems in the NHS will be legacy-defining for Mr Swinney but, far more importantly, for some patients, fixing it is a matter of life or death.",

      "content_en": "The Housing (Scotland) Bill sets out plans to make changes to the law covering rent controls, tenants’ rights and a mechanism to delay evictions under certain circumstances.\nHowever, Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman believes the Scottish Government’s current definition of domestic abuse within the context of the proposals is not broad enough to offer the necessary protections as the Greens believe it only covers violent, threatening and intimidating conduct.\nMs Chapman has lodged the changes in an amendment to the bill which would see controlling, coercive, and degrading behaviour included within the definition.\nYet, the Scottish Government has said the bill's definition of the term \"already covers the point\" Ms Chapman is raising, adding it is \"wide enough\" to capture \"physical or mental injury, fear, alarm or distress\".\nThe bill, as introduced to parliament this month, states abuse can cover \"violence, harassment, threatening conduct, and any other conduct giving rise, or likely to give rise, to physical or mental injury, fear, alarm or distress.\"\nREAD MORE:\nThe Green MSP has also lodged another amendment which would force the Scottish Government to implement findings of their December 2020 report on improving housing outcomes for women and children experiencing domestic abuse.\nMs Chapman said: “Women might feel unable to leave a violent and abusive relationship for fear of ending up homeless, and that sense of feeling trapped only increases when there are children involved in the process.\n“This bill must work to enhance the support we offer women and children, so that they are better protected and able to flee from abuse, without fear of being left homeless or placed in unsuitable and unsafe accommodation due to their experience of abuse not matching the government’s definition.\n“By expanding the definition of domestic abuse, we can help to resolve that fear and create a more hopeful future for women and their families who are rebuilding their lives.”\nThe expansion of the meaning in the bill is something which has been long called for by Scottish Women’s Aid as it would allow for the proposed legislation to be in line with the Domestic Abuse Act.\nDr Marsha Scott, the chief executive of the charity told The Herald: “These forms of abuse are among the most dangerous for women and children, yet the current definition focuses only on violent, threatening, and intimidating conduct.\n“Aligning the Bill with the Domestic Abuse (Scotland) Act 2018 is essential to ensure survivors are fully protected from all forms of abuse that can lead to homelessness. No survivor should be left without the support and security they need.”\nShelter Scotland has said they welcome any proposals which they believe will \"strengthen protections\" around domestic abuse.\nTheir support comes after their joint report with Engender last year which highlighted the “devastating reality” women are faced with when met with barriers in accessing safe and secure housing.\nIt showed barriers were particularly pronounced for minoritised women including, disabled women, LGBT+ women, and women of colour.\nThe charity’s director of communications and advocacy, Gordon MacRae said: “Scotland’s housing system is not only broken but biased as well, with women being disproportionately affected.\n“We know that when it comes to housing, councils are breaking the law on an industrial scale, denying support to those who need it and are entitled to it; for a woman fleeing domestic abuse the consequences of being turned away could be utterly catastrophic, so we welcome proposals that strengthen protections around domestic abuse.”\nMinisters have said the definition in the bill already includes sufficient measures to protect domestic abuse victims, as they say protecting survivors is a \"priority\" for government.\nHousing Minister Paul McLennan said: “Domestic abuse and other forms of gender-based violence are abhorrent and utterly unacceptable and supporting victim-survivors with their housing needs continues to be a priority for this government.\n“We share Ms Chapman’s desire to protect women who are experiencing domestic abuse and are sympathetic to her proposal. However, we believe that the Housing Bill and amendments already cover the points she is raising.\n“We have introduced provisions in the Housing Bill updating the definition of domestic abuse in line with more recent domestic abuse legislation. Our current definition is wide enough to capture behaviours which give rise, or are likely to give rise, to physical or mental injury, fear, alarm or distress.\n“We look forward to working with Ms Chapman during Stage 2 to deliver a Bill that does what we all want it to do – protect women.”",

      "content_en": "For nearly four years, a fierce debate raged over the future of the Wyndford estate in Glasgow, dividing residents and sparking wider national controversy. Was the demolition of its high-rises an environmental travesty or the first step toward much-needed regeneration?\nThe dispute began in November 2021, days after the city hosted the UN climate conference Cop26, at which politicians and businesses promised to curb wasteful building destruction. Yet residents of Wyndford soon found leaflets on their doorsteps heralding a “bright new future” – one that involved the demolition of all four high-rise blocks on the estate. The decision set off years of protests, legal challenges and community divisions.\nThe fight came to a head on Sunday, when three of the four 1960s tower blocks were finally reduced to rubble in a controlled demolition.\nWyndford estate was built between 1961 and 1969 on the site of a former military barracks. Commissioned by the Harold Macmillan government, it was intended as an exemplar of high-quality public housing, a rebuttal to Glasgow’s legacy of cheap and poorly planned social accommodation.\nView image in fullscreen The four high-rise blocks of the Wyndford estate one week before demolition. Three blocks were demolished by controlled explosion on 23 March – the block on the left will be brought down floor by floor because of its proximity to other homes on the estate\nBut 60 years later, part of that vision had faded. Its one-bedroom high-rise flats had become synonymous with short-term tenancies, and labelled a hotspot of neglect and social deprivation. Wheatley Group, Scotland’s largest landlord, argued that the blocks were no longer fit for purpose and should be replaced with modern family homes.\nA determined coalition of residents, activists, and conservationists, led by the Wyndford Residents Union (WRU), fiercely opposed the demolitions. At the heart of their campaign was a belief that the destruction of social housing during a housing crisis was not only irresponsible but unnecessary.\nBring down these flats and give the people the houses that they have been crying out for Henry Mclaren\nView image in fullscreen Henry McLaren, a Wyndford resident and focus group member\nDespite the protests, occupations, and legal challenges, Wheatley Group remained steadfast. Aisling Mylrea, the director of Wheatley Homes Glasgow, emphasised that legal challenges had been shut down every time and that all the permissions had been in place for the demolition to go ahead. She said: “Over 85% of the tenants of the scheme support the demolition and the £100m investment that will follow for the area.”\nHenry McLaren, a Wyndford resident and member of the Future Focus Group set up by Wheatley, said: “ This will be all good for the community. The words ‘focus’ and ‘future’ are important – everyone needs to stay focused on the end goal.”\nThey’ve run this place down – making it the worst place to live. Now they want to blow up the flats and make it the best Laura Jones\nView image in fullscreen Laura Jones, 38, Wyndford resident\nFrom the outset, Wheatley Group insisted that retrofitting the high-rise flats and making them into larger homes was impossible and continually pointed to the declining popularity of high-rise social housing. However, many campaigners disputed the claim that retrofitting was unviable.\nA coalition of architects, conservationists and engineers conducted studies suggesting the buildings could have been modernised and repurposed. Malcolm Fraser, a leading architect and campaigner, also called into question the 85% figure cited for support of the demolition, arguing that no alternative to demolition was ever seriously presented. “That number reflects only the few hundred tenants who responded, and they were never given the option of retrofitting,” he said.\nWe’ve been surrounded by rubble for months. The last block nearest to me … is being brought down piece by piece Caz\nView image in fullscreen Caz, a member of Wyndford Residents Union\nAs the demolition date approached, tensions mounted. For many residents, the stark reality of the controlled explosions in their neighbourhood took centre stage. Fears of further protests and block occupations prompted demolition contractors to station 24-hour security at the entrance to each tower. People living near the demolition site expressed concerns for their homes, and were angered after being offered a £100 Tesco voucher as compensation for vacating their properties for up to 10 hours on the day of the blast.\nThis place was beautiful when we moved in here … It’s different now … it all feels like a mad rush just to get us out Angie Thompson\nView image in fullscreen Angie Thompson, a Wyndford resident\nWheatley Group assured the residents that all safety measures had been met, stating: “Safedem are world-leading demolition contractors. They have carried out similar demolitions worldwide, ensuring all asbestos and hazardous materials were removed in advance.”\nView image in fullscreen Nick Durie, an Alba party politician and member of the Wyndford Residents Union\nWheatley Group says it wants to replace the 600 one-bedroom and bedsit flats with 400 new family homes, citing an urgent need for larger, modern housing in Glasgow. Yet campaigners remain unconvinced that this will truly benefit the community, given the overall reduction in social housing units. As the dust settled on demolition day, Nick Durie, an Alba politician and WRU member, made it clear that the battle was far from over. “This isn’t the end – it’s just the beginning. Our fight will continue long after the demolition. We will protest and challenge every stage of the new development until they commit to replacing all 600 social homes they’ve torn down,” he said.\nWe will continue to fight their planning application and to politicise it Nick Durie\nBeyond the loss of homes, the demolition has drawn criticism from climate activists and architects alarmed by the environmental toll. With an estimated 47,000 tonnes of embodied carbon released in the demolition process, some argue that the destruction contradicts the climate commitments made at Cop26.\nView image in fullscreen William Doolan, a Wyndford resident.\nI won’t be watching the demolition, don’t want to see it happening, it was my home William Doolan\nFraser summed up the frustration: “I know that every building we put up today will last about 40 years. These flats, if properly retrofitted, could have lasted for centuries. We need to stop this cycle of waste and destruction.”\nA UK-wide policy that exempts new buildings and demolitions from VAT has only reinforced the preference for demolition over retrofitting. Critics warn that without policy changes, the cycle will continue: “Big business thrives on knocking down old buildings, landfilling them and starting again. And so it goes on and on.”\nView image in fullscreen The four high-rise blocks of the Wyndford estate one week before demolition\nThree of Wyndford’s towers have now been reduced to rubble, joining the many high-rise schemes that have vanished from Glasgow’s skyline. Yet the battle over their legacy – debates on the environmental cost of demolition and the future of social housing – remains far from settled.",

      "content_en": "Scottish voters are divided over Scotland’s policy of free tuition for Scottish students as the crisis over university finances intensified.\nA poll commissioned by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland found that up to 48% of voters believe Scottish students who can afford it should pay for tuition, with 29% opposed.\nA different multiple-choice question produced a closer result. It found 43% believed those who could afford to should pay, while 44% felt every student should get free tuition.\nScottish universities are among a growing number across the UK in deep financial peril, with Dundee expected to be the first to receive part of a £10m government bailout.\nFree tuition for undergraduates was first introduced in 2008 by the Scottish National party, in a vote-winning move to scrap the graduate endowment tax then used to partly pay for tuition in Scotland.\nHowever, free tuition has come under much greater scrutiny after Dundee University revealed it was on the brink of insolvency, while Edinburgh University plans to cut £140m to avoid going into deficit.\nScottish universities receive £7,610 per head to teach Scottish students, less than the £9,250 English and Welsh universities can charge, at a total cost of about £715m a year.\nThat means universities rely on foreign students paying full-cost fees to subsidise teaching costs for Scottish students. The number of overseas students coming to Scotland fell by 10,000 in 2023-24, adding to the financial pressures and increasing competition between universities.\nThe free tuition policy also means the Scottish government caps the number of Scottish students who can go to university, which prevents some Scots from getting the university places they want.\nThe trust, set up in 1901 by the Scottish-born US industrialist Andrew Carnegie, is establishing a citizens’ jury to review how Scottish universities should be funded.\nIt will be formed in April with 22 participants of different backgrounds taking part in six online evidence sessions. It is due to report in January 2026, four months before the next Scottish parliament election.\nHannah Garrow, the trust’s chief executive, said it believed there was an evidence gap about what voters really thought. “We’ve known for some time that something needs to change. We need to have a more open and nuanced debate about it.”\nA spokesperson for Universities Scotland, the sector’s representative body, supported the move. “For far too long Scotland’s conversation about university funding has been in a binary loop of free versus fees. It’s time to move beyond that,” she said.\nThe Scottish government said its commitment to free tuition would not change. “Access to higher education should be based on the ability to learn – not the ability to pay,” a spokesperson said.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Staff at Brunel University of London will strike for three days to protest against more than 400 job cuts.\nAlthough universities in England receive more tuition funding per student than their peers in Scotland, they receive less in direct grants from government, and the value of domestic fees has been sharply eroded by inflation.",

      "content_en": "It is the UK’s largest body of fresh water, its volume totalling more than all the lakes of England and Wales combined. It is also the UK’s greatest source of daft stories. For the best part of a century, Loch Ness has used its monster-adjacent status not only to finance a healthy tourist economy, but also to generate a small industry in Nessie-related fiction, from the inspired to the crackpot. The Simpsons sent Mr Burns to do battle with the creature in an episode called Monty Can’t Buy Me Love. From the pen of poet Ted Hughes came Nessie the Mannerless Monster, who was tired of being told she does not exist. And indie folkster Matilda Mann has a song called The Loch Ness Monster, containing this advice: “Stay right down there.” Not wanting to be left out, the Royal Mail has just honoured Nessie with a fine, if rather unscary, stamp.\nTo these slithery ranks we will shortly be able to add Nessie, a family musical written and composed by Glasgow’s Shonagh Murray and about to premiere in Edinburgh and Pitlochry. Murray was reluctant to tackle such a familiar Scottish icon, until a challenge from her father drew her in. “I had just finished doing a couple of shows about the women behind Robert Burns,” she says. “I was joking with my dad that I needed to find something a wee bit less Scottish. He was like: ‘Oh, there’s loads of Scottish stories that have been told – but not to their full potential. You should do a Nessie musical.’ On a dare, I wrote an opening number. The more I was writing, the more I liked it. There was something charming and special about it.”\nI never met the monster, said the writer of The Secret of the Loch after her research, but I did find a wonderful whisky\nDespite claims to the contrary, the story goes back no further than May 1933. That was when hotel proprietor Donaldina Mackay and her husband John, driving along the north shore of the loch, claimed to have seen a large creature on the surface. They said it resembled a whale and described it rolling for a minute before disappearing. Their testimony, reported by the Inverness Courier, set off a summer of sighting claims. At the time, the dinosaur-battling King Kong was becoming a monster hit in cinemas, but here was a fearsome creature on Scotland’s very own soil (or loch).\nView image in fullscreen Mr Burns and the monster … The Simpsons. Photograph: Youtube\nBy October, the Scotsman newspaper, having gathered several testimonies, was declaring: “The fact that the loch does contain a creature much larger than any loch fish is evidently beyond all question.” People did question it, however – and only two days later, the same paper quoted a zoology professor speculating that the creature was a “large lump of waterlogged peat”. His view was countered by those who reckoned it was a plesiosaurus that had missed the memo about extinction.\nAny good myth needs a backstory and Nessie advocates were soon looking around for some ancient pedigree. Step forward St Columba who, in the sixth century, supposedly fended off a “certain aquatic monster” by making the sign of the cross. This took place at the river Ness and not the loch, but it was all the evidence they needed to show Nessie had staying power. No one dwelt on the fact that, according to Adomnán, the saint’s biographer, Columba had form on this kind of thing, having variously silenced a storm, raised a boy from the dead, and turned a pail of milk into a demon.\n“There are so many could-be-real sightings and so many hoax sightings,” says Murray. “But I like the not knowing. I like the mystery of it and the idea the natural world is playing a trick on us.”\nView image in fullscreen ‘Terrible’ … an iguana as Nessie in 1934’s The Secret of the Loch. Photograph: Youtube\nFilm-makers quickly jumped on board the Nessie bandwagon. Released a year after that first sighting, The Secret of the Loch was a lighthearted romance that culminated in a young London reporter having an underwater showdown with Nessie. It was edited by David Lean, no less, and called “terrible” by its own writer, Charles Bennett, who co-wrote it with a woman called Billie Bristow. The pair went to Scotland for research, with Bristow declaring: “I never met the monster, but I found a wonderful scotch whisky.” The monster, meanwhile, was played by a young green iguana.\nView image in fullscreen Rather unscary … the new stamp. Photograph: Royal Mail/PA\nFor all its faults, The Secret of the Loch set out what elements were required for this new genre. Choose pretty much any Nessie movie – from 2001’s appalling Beneath Loch Ness, shot mainly in California, to 1996’s Loch Ness, which is worth seeing for Keith Allen as a deranged Nessie hunter – and charge your glasses for a drinking game of monster proportions. Your task is to spot arrogant outsiders, stereotyped locals and sceptical scientists. There are bonus shots for unconvincing special effects, and if you plan to sink a wee dram for every terrible Scottish accent, you should first seek medical advice.\nIn The Secret of the Loch, Frederick Peisley plays the cub reporter Jimmy Andrews, who is determined to get a story out of one of the few scientists convinced the monster is real. Even before he leaves London, Jimmy is trying out his highland flings and hackneyed Scottish phrases. Once he gets to Loch Ness, he finds himself in a low-ceilinged tavern where the drinkers are as cautious with their money as they are with their conversation.\nMuch the same pub with much the same clientele appears in every subsequent Nessie film. But there is one change: it tends to be loud-mouthed Americans, rather than patrician Englishmen, who treat Scotland so condescendingly. Countless curmudgeonly locals are shown knocking back whisky, withholding hospitality and fighting ancient clan battles, while the sophisticated incomers sort out fact from fiction. A rare exception is the 1980s cartoon series The Family-Ness, which is told from the perspective of local children (not that you would know from the accents).\nView image in fullscreen Kids are the key … final touches for the new musical Nessie. Photograph: Fraser Band\nAs the composer of Nessie, Murray is allowing herself to lean into the Scottishness, but with more authenticity. “It’s Scottish folk meeting musical theatre,” she says when we meet at Pitlochry Festival theatre and look out at the rolling hills and the tree-lined River Tummel with its famous fish ladder. “We’re nodding to the heritage of where the story is. I came up here when I was writing and I would walk in the gardens and over the dam. It massively sped up my writing process. The music has a flow in the underwater moments and gives a grounding to the moments that need a callback to Scottish trad, rather than Instagram.”\nAs the excellent Mythillogical podcast points out in its Nessie special, The Secret of the Loch also established a trope about the scientific establishment. For belief in the monster to persist, a way must be found to dismiss any rational objectors, so nearly every movie features a diehard sceptic who is ultimately proved wrong in the most dramatic, tumultuous fashion, invariably by the appearance of the monster, rather fabulously in the case of that iguana.\nAppropriately, given the number of fraudsters who have targeted Nessie, another common plotline is forgery. In fact, many of the most accomplished – and certainly funniest – films have been about fakes. In their short film Another Fine Ness, the Chuckle Brothers turn the monster lore into a joke as they fake footprints and whip out a tartan glove puppet in an attempt to win a Nessie-spotting competition. Similarly, in the 1961 comedy What a Whopper, Adam Faith plays a hard-up writer who thinks he might find a market for his Nessie book if he contrives a sighting. As his scheme goes hilariously wrong, he comes up with this superb justification for his plan: “I had psychology on my side: they wanted to see something.”\nView image in fullscreen ‘Interested in the difference between fact and truth’ … Werner Herzog in Incident at Loch Ness.\nBest of all is the mockumentary Incident at Loch Ness, a great cineaste in-joke in which Werner Herzog is followed by a film crew as he supposedly makes a documentary called The Enigma of Loch Ness. “I’ve always been interested in the difference between fact and truth,” deadpans the director of Fitzcarraldo and Grizzly Man hilariously, as he asks his producer to find an “obsessed but credible” cryptozoologist to interview. His other requests include shots of Highland games, whisky, urchins and a “shepherd with a flock”. Herzog also has a thing about beards. The more he seeks the truth, the more his producer tries to fake the monster – and the more the “real” monster intervenes.\nMurray, for her part, is partly using the legend to question our relationship with the environment. “So many people are flippant and dismissive of the Loch Ness monster,” she says. “You’re more likely to buy into its magic through children. For Mara, our lead character, it’s about speaking up for the natural world that she loves – and cutting through the noise of the adult voices.”",

      "content_en": "Holyrood is becoming a “hostile environment for women” and a significant number of female MSPs in the Scottish National party are stepping down before the May 2026 elections, citing lack of support from the party, tolerance of bullying, and abuse in the chamber and online.\nAlmost four years on from the election of a record number of 58 female MSPs across all parties in 2021, 14 SNP women have so far said they will not stand again, accounting for 23% of the party’s current MSP group.\nWhile some departures were expected, such as the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon and the 80-year-old veteran Christine Grahame, other exits raise questions about why women with seemingly burgeoning careers are choosing to step away.\nMichelle Thomson, who is standing down as MSP for Falkirk East, having previously served at Westminster, told the Guardian: “Politics is generally very misogynist, and I don’t think the SNP can be complacent about its own internal mechanisms which mean that examples of inappropriate male behaviour – including bullying and sexual harassment – are not tackled.”\nElena Whitham, an SNP former minister and another MSP not seeking re-election, said: “It’s not just about barriers to entry but to staying in politics. Neither party nor parliament are able to effectively support women when they encounter difficulties, and that’s why we are losing far too many talented women to the detriment of democracy.”\nThese concerns were shared by other SNP women who told the Guardian there was a chronic lack of support from the party, including for those with younger families. Some mentioned factional tensions and bullying within the party involving other female MSPs.\nNatalie Don-Innes is standing down as MSP for Renfrewshire North and West, citing “the sacrifices that being an elected member and a mother brings”.\nBut other women raised concerns about the Holyrood environment itself.\n“The bullying, booing and braying from the Tory benches whenever an SNP woman makes a progressive intervention is awful. Women feel they can’t speak up, especially on issues like LGBT+ inclusion,” said one former party official who regularly visited the parliament.\nOthers worry that the atmosphere will get worse if Reform UK wins upwards of 10 Holyrood seats, as polling predicts, and if former SNP MPs ousted in the party’s catastrophic general election defeat last July bring a more combative Westminster culture to the Scottish parliament.\nSome fear this is already happening, after reports that allies of the SNP’s leader in the House of Commons, Stephen Flynn, have a “hitlist” of sitting MSPs – all women – whom they hope to replace with former MPs in May next year.\nFlynn faced a fierce backlash last autumn when he announced that he planned to stand for Holyrood – potentially pushing out the incumbent female MSP – while maintaining his Westminster seat.\nHolyrood sources said that in addition to what could be bruising contests to select candidates, there were concerns the SNP would face a very difficult election because of its funding difficulties and a substantial drop in membership after the police investigation into its finances.\nIt is understood that has also weighed on some MSPs’ thinking.\nThis is all happening against a background of increasing online abuse, with a recent Holyrood magazine survey finding that female MSPs of all parties faced rape threats, death threats and severe misogynistic abuse.\nAlthough the SNP’s leader, John Swinney, has maintained Sturgeon’s tradition of a gender-balanced cabinet, some women described themselves as “furious” and “appalled” that equal representation reforms brought in by Sturgeon, including ensuring all-women lists where MSPs stood down, had been ditched for the next election.\nThe SNP said its legal advice was that because it achieved a 50/50 gender balance in 2021, it could not put in place similar corrective mechanisms this time.\nThe approved candidates list, circulated to SNP members last week, included 64 women (42%) out of a total of 152.\nThomson said there was “a very real risk that the SNP could take a significant step back in 2026”, pointing too to the lack of diversity among the approved men on the list.\n“The SNP put in all-women shortlists without looking at the systemic misogyny within the party,” said one prominent backbencher, “and it just elected women to a tough position with very little support. Holyrood is becoming a hostile environment for women.”",

      "content_en": "Star/Steer is a masterpiece from 1968 by the Scottish artist Ian Hamilton Finlay (1925-2006). What you see can be simply described. The word “star” appears a dozen times, screenprinted in silver on deep grey. They graduate down the page in a swaying column. Right at the bottom is a 13th word, “steer”, as if tethering – or guided by – all these descending stars.\nEach star is like an instance of itself, glimmering out of a fog, and the winding pattern irresistibly evokes starlight on rippling water. You look up to the stars, and down to the invisible boat summoned by that noun-verb “steer”. Which star to follow, how to navigate at sea, what the night skies can hold: the work is a visualisation, a poem and a prayer.\nView image in fullscreen Star/Steer, 1968 by Ian Hamilton Finlay: ‘a poem and a prayer’. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\nFinlay achieves all these sublime effects purely through the subtle arrangement of two words against two colours. His is an art of distillation, juxtaposition, thrift and contemplation. A poet before he became a concrete poet, a sculptor who became an “avant gardener”, as he put it, of that fabled landscape known as Little Sparta in the Pentland Hills beyond Edinburgh, Finlay understood as few other artists the emotional power of letters cutting into form, shape and colour.\nYou sense it over and again in this wonderful centenary commemoration at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. It’s there in the blue and white screenprint Evening Sail, which consists of the words “Evening Will Come They Will Sew the Blue Sail” running in classical script down a long deep blue banner, as if to suggest both the sail and the mariners’ shrouds sewn in antiquity from such sails at the end of the day. It’s there in the scarlet invectives, so exquisitely lettered on his behalf by Nicholas Sloan, against the government quangos Finlay despised: Pereant Tyranni Nummari (Let Perish the Money Tyrants).\nView image in fullscreen ‘Scarlet invectives’: Posters against the SAC: Pereant Tyranni Nummari (with Nicholas Sloan). Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\nAnd it runs through this show, as through his Pentlands garden, incised in all kinds of stone. A tank is delicately inserted into the pastoral relief Et in Arcadia Ego, embodying Virgil’s ringing memento mori, carved in the marble below. A bird table for Finlay’s garden doubles as a miniature aircraft carrier (imagine the birds landing and taking off), the letter E incised into its deck, a reference to the USS Enterprise, the longest nuclear-powered carrier in the world.\nOne gallery is filled with haunting photographs of Finlay’s artists’ signatures at Little Sparta, including his tribute to Albrecht Dürer. Above a stand of tall grass resembling Dürer’s own Great Piece of Turf, hangs his famous AD monogram incised in stone – as if Dürer had himself signed nature.\nHis art scarcely seems to comply with an embattled personality at constant war with institutions\nFinlay selects the mot juste with a poet’s precision. Take a work such as Wave Rock from 1966. The word “wave” runs back and forth, horizontally, up against a vertical heap of the word “rock”. The waves meet, depart, always unpredictable in their encounter with the rocks. Look closer, and the words “wreak” and “wreck” become discernible in the collision of letters. And all these words are etched on a sheet of sandblasted glass propped up in a bit of driftwood, like a letter in a rack. Everything flows, and connects.\nFinlay’s art is so refined, philosophical, antic in its wit and elegance, that it scarcely seems to comply with an embattled personality at constant war with institutions, galleries and publishers. But his long-running conflicts were notorious. A vivid gallery of films and photographs recounts his 1980s campaign against Strathclyde council for trying to force him to pay business rates on an old byre that he had converted into a classical temple. Local farmers joined in, blocking the marauding tax officials with their tractors. I especially like the poster Shock Tropes for Little Sparta (Sparta, of course, was at war with Athens).\nView image in fullscreen Wave Rock, 1966. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay\n“Mors Concilio Artium” (Death to the Arts Council) is inscribed on blazing prints. When the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) accidentally returned some of Finlay’s stone carvings, his revenge was classical. The names of council functionaries, along with other enemies – including well-known painters and poets such as Elizabeth Blackadder and Iain Crichton Smith – are now carved in perpetuity on the back, along with a rousing tribute to Robespierre. Not incidentally, the SAC eventually gave them to the nation.\nThe French Revolution, battles on land and sea, historical warfare – all have enduring significance in Finlay’s art. He joined up in the second world war and his own position is always ambiguous. Two curious stone boots, exquisitely carved by John Andrew, are in fact representations of the funnels of the Mikuma, a Japanese cruiser deployed during the war. Terrifying on a vast scale, they are reduced to what Finlay ironically called paperweights. But lest we forget, the Mikuma was sunk in 1942 by the US with most of its crew.\nView image in fullscreen Et in Arcadia Ego, 1976 by Finlay, with John Andrew. Photograph: © the estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay © the estate of John Andrew\nIt feels apt that such a show should take place in the neoclassical grandeur of the former Dean Orphanage in Edinburgh. One of the most immaculate works here – poised between antiquity and conceptualism – is the tiny Marble Paper Boat, in which an origami vessel crests the fluted waves of a stone finial that would not look out of place in the Georgian architecture of the city’s New Town.\nIf only this exhibition stretched from the ground floor to the upper galleries too. But Finlay is widely spread in his centenary year, with several other shows, including one at Victoria Miro, London (30 April-24 May), and an illustrated book of essays by writers including the late, lamented Tom Lubbock.\nWhat makes this particular exhibition so special, moreover, is its emphasis on the intimate: many small sculptures raised up to perfect viewing levels on plinths, the walls dense with exquisite screenprints. What you see is Finlay’s mind in closeup – words and ideas forming into two- and three-dimensional works of unique and visionary art.",

[As] I have said to all of you many times, I have done nothing wrong, so I was confident of reaching this point but obviously it is a relief now to have that confirmed,” she said.\n“For almost two years I have had this cloud of investigation hanging over me. It won’t surprise anybody to hear me say that’s not been an easy experience, so to reach this point today is obviously something I am relieved about. I’ve been trying to go on with my life and I now intend to do that.”\nBeattie told reporters at Holyrood on Thursday he was very relieved to have been cleared, and said he intended to stand again for parliament next year.\n“I knew myself I had done nothing wrong but two years is a long time to wait for a result,” he said. “I’ve had tremendous support from constituents and members. I can at least relax and get back to family life now.”\nThe confirmation came after it emerged that Murrell, who served as the SNP’s chief executive for 22 years, had made no plea during his court appearance, a routine hearing that formally begins the prosecution process.\nThe Crown Office has not yet released the charge against him.\nMurrell was arrested in April 2023 after police came to the home he then shared with Sturgeon in Uddingston, as police mounted a simultaneous raid on the SNP’s headquarters near the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh.\nPolice erected tents outside their detached home, carrying out extensive searches of the property and its garden and shed, while removing documents and computers from their home and the SNP’s offices.\nPolice later confiscated a luxury motorhome parked outside Murrell’s mother’s home in Fife.\nAfter being released pending further investigation, Murrell was rearrested on 18 April 2024 and charged with embezzlement. In late 2024, Police Scotland submitted an extensive report to the Crown Office, setting out the evidence it had gathered.\nMurrell has made no public comment about his arrest or the investigation, but Sturgeon has repeatedly said she was innocent of any wrongdoing since her arrest in June 2023.\nSturgeon, whose memoirs will be published in August, announced in January that she and Murrell were to divorce and indicated they had been living separate lives for some time. Earlier in March, she confirmed she would not be standing for re-election to Holyrood in next year’s Scottish parliament elections.",

      "content_en": "The men’s Tour de France will return to Britain in July 2027 with a spectacular city-centre Grand Départ in Edinburgh and three stages that trace a route from Scotland through England and into Wales.\nIt will be the third Tour race start in Britain in the past 20 years, after London in 2007 and Yorkshire in 2014, and the most logistically demanding Grand Départ in the century-long history of the race.\nIn an unprecedented move, the Tour de France Femmes will also begin in the UK in 2027, with the start of that race expected to be staged in Yorkshire later in the summer.\nThe success of the UK bid to bring the world’s biggest bike race back to Britain was confirmed on Wednesday afternoon in Edinburgh as Mark Cavendish, the record stage winner in the Tour, led celebrations on the Royal Mile.\nRecalling the Grand Départ in London in 2007, Cavendish, who retired last season, said his main memory of the crowds was “not being able to stop to pee, because there were so many people at the roadside”.\n“Edinburgh fits perfectly into what the Tour is about,” he said. “It’s only going to inspire. You can’t help but want to go out on your bike.”\nThe Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, described the spectacle of the race as “the only sports event made for people who don’t like sport” and recalled seeing riders applauding spectators in Yorkshire in 2014. “That’s very rare,” he said.\nThere will be six Tour stages in total in the UK in 2027, three stages of the men’s Tour and three of the women’s race. “I think it’s brilliant,” Cavendish said. “Cycling’s been at the forefront of pushing equality.”\nThe conversations between Edinburgh and Paris stretch back almost 20 years, but the project became more ambitious once the Tour de France Femmes was relaunched three years ago.\nView image in fullscreen Charlotte Kool celebrates victory in the first stage of the Tour de France Femmes, from Rotterdam to the Hague, in 2024. Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/Shutterstock\n“We set out to host the Tour de France and Tour de France Femmes because we believe that live sport is a fundamental part of our country’s social fabric,” Simon Morton, director of events at UK Sport, said.\n“This will be the biggest free spectator event ever hosted in the UK, offering the public front-row access to world-class sport across villages, towns and cities.”\nThe details of the men’s race are to be confirmed but Edinburgh, Glasgow, the Lake District, Manchester, mid-Wales and south Wales are all expected to feature.\nAfter a stage finish in Cardiff, the race convoy is likely to transfer from south Wales to continue the Tour on French soil.\nIn 2014 more than 3 million spectators were estimated to have watched the men’s race as it headed to London from Leeds. That number will surely be eclipsed in 2027.\nThe 2027 Tour de France Femmes is believed to be starting in Leeds. The Tour owners, ASO, remained coy about the details of the women’s race, although Prudhomme said the women’s race may fall a little later than usual to accommodate event logistics.\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Recap Free weekly newsletter The best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s action Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

You see the impact it has everywhere the Tour goes. You saw it in Yorkshire, a few years back, so it will be really special. It will give such a boost to cycling in Scotland and it gives me a lot of motivation to be there, to be part of that.”\nPete Ellen, who runs the Cycling Academy for elite young Scottish road cyclists and who rides with the Edinburgh Road Club, one of the country’s largest, said the arrival of the Tour was “brilliant” for cycling in Scotland.\n“It’s incredibly well run, and they’re really good at getting community involvement,” he said. “It will get more people on their bicycles, riding around and having fun. The more people who are riding their bikes the better the world will be. It’s as simple as that.”\nThe Aberaeron-born Josh Tarling, who is racing with Ineos Grenadiers, said the news that the 2027 Tour would visit Wales was “a proud moment”.\nThe intention to bid for the Tour, as part of a £30m package for major events first announced in Rishi Sunak’s autumn budget in 2021, originally targeted a Grand Départ in 2026, but next year’s Tour will start in Barcelona.\nFurther details of all the stages are expected to be announced in the autumn.",

      "content_en": "From 5d ago 11.43 EDT Starmer's failure to defend new Pip eligibility rules at PMQs show why 'cruel' plans should be dropped, Labour MP says The Labour MP Richard Burgon has said that Keir Starmer’s failure to answer in detail a question about how the Pip (personal independence payment) entitlement rules will work under the reforms announced yesterday shows why the plans should be dropped. In a post on social media, Burgon said: The prime minister was unable to answer a simple question today about why a disabled person who needs help to eat, wash and manage toilet needs could no longer get Pip under his proposals. The government must drop this cruel proposal or it’ll face the mother of all rebellions. Burgon was referring to what happened when the SDLP MP Colum Eastwood asked Starmer to justify the new Pip rules. (See 12.54pm.) Eastwood said: A lady came to see me recently who needed help. She had a disability. It meant that her children had to help her cut up her food. They have to help her wash beneath her waist. They have to supervise her as she goes to the toilet. Under the Tory welfare system we were able to get that lady on Pip. Under the prime minister’s new proposed system, she will get zero, nothing. And after 14 years of the Tory government – and many of us wanted to see the back of them – can the prime minister answer one question – what was the point if Labour are going to do this? In response, Starmer said that lived with the impact of disability through his mother (who had Still’s disease and was in a wheelchair for much of his life) and through his brother (who had learning difficulties), but that he thought the current welfare system was “indefensible”. He did not say why Eastwood’s constituent should lose her Pip, but he said under the government’s plans “if you can never work, you must be supported and protected”. On Newsnight last night the SNP MP Kirsty Blackman made a similar point about how the new Pip rules will work. She said: If you, for example, can’t put on your own trousers, if you cannot get in and out of the shower yourself, if you are not able to go to the toilet without supervision, you still may not make the criteria [to keep getting Pip], because none of those things get you four points. Blackman was referring to the change in the eligibility rules set out in the green paper yesterday. It says: We will introduce a new eligibility requirement to ensure that only those who score a minimum of 4 points in at least one daily living activity will be eligible for the daily living component of Pip. This requirement will need to be met in addition to the existing Pip eligibility criteria. This means that people who have lower needs only in the daily living activities (scoring 3 or less for each activity) will no longer be eligible for the daily living component of Pip. Meanwhile, people with a higher level of functional need in at least one activity – for example, people who are unable to complete activities at all, or who require more help from others to complete them – will still receive Pip. Pip works on a points system, where points are awarded by level of disability in relation to various activities. There is a guide to the points here. Share\n5d ago 13.15 EDT Hancock dismisses criticism of 'VIP lane' for PPE procurement during Covid crisis as 'wholly naive' Matt Hancock has described criticism of the so-called “VIP lane” that meant some PPE contract offers were prioritisied for Whitehall consideration during Covid as “wholly naive”. Giving evidence to the Covid inquiry in a hearing held as part of its PPE module, the former health secretary was asked about evidence submitted by an expert describing the “VIP lane” process as “problematic”, in part because there was “no consideration given to the risk of de facto differential treatment”. At a time when the government was desperate to acquire PPE, and inundated with offers from contractors largely unknown to Whitehall, the “VIP lane” enabled ministers to recommend offers from people who contacted them directly for priority consideration. The government defended the scheme on the grounds that final decisions were always taken by officials. But the initiative continues to be mired in controversy, not least because it was used by the Tory peer Michelle Mone to obtain contracts that are now subject to an ongoing criminal investigation. Asked about the expert’s comment criticising the scheme, Hancock replied: What I would say about that particular paragraph that you read out is that it is wholly naive as to the circumstances that we face. The point about naivety is really, really important. It’s fine having academics write papers about this stuff, and some of the academic analysis of how you could do better in a future pandemic is really, really valuable. But it can only have any value at all if you understand what it was like. You know, you weren’t there. This professor wasn’t there. But you’ve got to understand what it was like. The pressure to save lives is intense, but so is the reality that high-quality offers will come through and be sent through to senior decision makers, and you have to have a process for dealing with that. Apologising for being “impassioned” in his evidence, Hancock went on: I have been subject to enormous amounts of conspiracy theories about what went on here when, in fact, what happened was so many people working as hard as they could to save lives, and they bought more PPE as a result, and therefore people are alive who would otherwise be dead. And frankly, I’m incredibly proud of the people who themselves have felt under attack because of the way that questions have been put, which does have a material consequence on future responses to a pandemic. Hancock also said it was important to ensure that, in future, “more bureaucracy” did not get in the way of effective procurement in an equivalent crisis.

As PA Media reports, speaking to reporters in Grangemouth, the first minister said Keir Starmer’s government wanted to enact cuts that would punish “the most vulnerable in our society”. During the general election campaign last year, Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, had told voters: “Read my lips: no austerity under Labour.” The SNP claims the benefit cuts announced yesterday, among other measures, amount to austerity – something that has been rejected by Sarwar but echoed by a senior member of his team at Holyrood, PA says. Carol Mochan, Scottish Labour’s public health spokeswoman, contradicted her boss in a social media post on the welfare cuts by saying: Austerity has never been a sustainable path to growth. We cannot balance the books on the backs of people who require benefits just to have a passable standard of living. These reforms are a mistake and should not go ahead. Swinney said he “could not fathom what the Labour Government thinks it is doing”. He added: I think it’s made a number of huge mistakes already. The winter fuel cut was a disastrous mistake for the Labour government to make. That proposal was offered to the Tories on countless occasions and they never took it. The Labour Party has taken that cut and they’ve now taken cuts to disability benefits, which even the Tories didn’t do. Swinney also said he was “not surprised” the cuts led to Neil Findlay quitting the party. (See 11.13am.) And he claimed Sarwar had broken his pre-election pledge. We now know that Anas Sarwar’s words count for absolutely nothing. This is the return to austerity that I told everybody would happen unless some of the hard realities of the public finances were addressed. Labour are interested now in returning austerity and punishing the most vulnerable in our society. What disgrace the Labour party has become.

Photograph: Michael Boyd/PA Share Updated at 13.48 EDT\n5d ago 12.27 EDT In a Guardian column Frances Ryan says the plans for cuts to sickness and disability benefits announced yesterday are “rotten with contradictions and cruelty”. Here is an extract. Even with the U-turn, the bulk of the cuts will fall on the Pip budget, despite the benefit having nothing to do with employment. Indeed, removing Pip – which is often used to pay for taxis, mobility aids and care staff – is more likely to push disabled people out of employment. Pip is also a “gateway benefit”, and ministers are yet to address whether those losing it could see their families lose vital carer’s allowance too. Meanwhile, the plan to reduce UC for the whole “unfit to work category” will hit many severely ill and disabled people who will not be protected by the new premium. Ministers say this will “incentivise” people to stay in the work-search group, as if the reason a teacher confined to bed with ME quit her job is that she’s just not incentivised enough. This is austerity dressed up as reform, where the government cuts the money disabled people need to live on in order to balance the books, while claiming it’s all being done to help them. And here is Frances’ column. These cruel benefit cuts will rob security from so many – but Labour will lose something crucial too | Frances Ryan Read more Share\n5d ago 12.15 EDT After the Commons vote where MPs removed the Lords amendment to the NICs bill exempting care homes, hospice and other health-related businesses (see 3.07pm), there were five more votes rejected Lords amendments to the bill. The government won them all with three-figure majorities. These included Lords amendments exempting small charities from the NICs increase, and firms providing transport for children with special educational needs.

Share\n5d ago 11.22 EDT Commenting on the first vote on the Lords amendment to the NICs bill (see 3.07pm), Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem deputy leader and Treasury spokesperson, said: Labour MPs today have voted for a health tax on GPs, dentists, pharmacies, hospices and care homes, and it is patients who will pay the price. The Liberal Democrats are proud we have led the fight to exempt health and care providers from this misguided tax hike, and we will not give up now. On April 6 worried social care providers and GP surgeries are going to be hit with bills they simply cannot afford. Rachel Reeves must finally see sense, U-turn on this disastrous policy and exempt health and care providers from this damaging jobs tax. Share\n5d ago 11.07 EDT MPs vote to reject Lords amendment exempting hospices and care homes from employer NICs rise MPs have voted to reject a Lords amendment to the national insurance contributions (NICs) bill that would have exempted hospices, care homes, pharmacies and dentist from the increase in employer NICs announced in last years’ budget. The government won by 307 votes to 182 – a majority of 125. Defending the proposal to reject the amendment, James Murray, a Treasury minister, said that if the government did not get this income, other tax rises, cuts, or borrowing would be needed. He told MPs: We have had to take difficult but necessary decisions to repair the public finances and rebuild our public services … In order to restore fiscal responsibility and get public services back on their feet, we needed to raise revenue including through the measures that this Bill will introduce and many of the amendments from the other place put at risk the funding that this Bill seeks to raise. So let me be clear, to support these amendments is also to support higher borrowing, lower spending or other tax rises. But the Conservative MP Wendy Morton accused the government of “giving with one hand but taking away with the other”. She said: The hospice sector is just one example of many sectors which have been adversely affected by this cruel tax that the government is placing on them. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said the Lords had made 21 amendments to the government’s original bill. “Taken together they provide protections for health and care providers, for small charities with an annual revenue of less than £1 million, for transport providers for children with special educational needs and disabilities, for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees,” she said.

Today, we are celebrating breaking the 60,000 members point. Crucially, this growth in membership and political representation is organic, powered by our grassroots activists on the ground. Increasingly as the two tired old parties collapse, people are crying out for change. Greens are offering real hope, real change, and a real alternative.

PA says: Views are being sought over the move from victims, survivors and the public on what the day would be called, ways for victims to be commemorated and a date for the event. A 12-week consultation launched today comes after survivors of terror attacks have campaigned for more recognition and support for those affected by atrocities. The government has also announced plans to set up a new support hub to help victims in the immediate and long-term aftermath of terror attacks. Security minister Dan Jarvis said: “The impact of a terrorist attack is long-lasting and evolving.

Tories have suggested govt is planning move for next week. Share Updated at 09.58 EDT\n5d ago 09.53 EDT Starmer declines to repeat at PMQs Reeves' pledge not to extend income tax threshold freeze Here is the PA Media news story from PMQs. Keir Starmer failed to repeat the chancellor’s commitment not to extend the freeze on income tax, ahead of next week’s spring statement. Kemi Badenoch pressed the prime minister to reaffirm the pledge during PMQs. In the autumn budget, Rachel Reeves decided not to extend the freeze on the thresholds at which people start to pay different rates of income tax. Thresholds were initially frozen by the previous Conservative government until April 2028. In the Commons, the Conservative leader also accused Starmer of digging his own black hole and urged him to protect hospices from national insurance increases. Badenoch said: “The chancellor promised a once-in-a-parliament budget that she would not come back for more. And in that budget, she said there will be no extension of the freeze in income tax thresholds. Ahead of the emergency budget, will he repeat the commitment that she made?” Starmer replied: “She’s got such pre-scripted questions she can’t actually adapt them to the answers that I’m giving. I think she now calls herself a Conservative realist. Well, I’m realistic about the Conservatives. “The reality is they left open borders and she was the cheerleader. They crashed the economy, mortgages went through the roof. The NHS was left on its knees, and they hollowed out the armed forces. “This government has already delivered two million extra NHS appointments, 750 breakfast clubs, record returns of people who shouldn’t be here, and a fully-funded increase in our defence spending. That is the difference that a Labour government makes.” UPDATE: Reeves is not going to extend the income tax threshold freeze in the spring statement, the Guardian understands. See 1.57pm.

      "content_en": "There is a realistic chance that one of the UK’s largest oil refineries can be converted into a hub for green chemicals, sustainable fuels and plastics, Scotland’s first minister says.\nGrangemouth oil refinery, which is being shut down by its UK and Chinese owners PetroIneos this year with the loss of 400 jobs, could become a world leader in low carbon chemicals and green fuels, John Swinney told media on Wednesday.\nThe refinery’s closure, after 100 years of production, is expected to hit up to 2,000 jobs in the east of Scotland. Trade union leaders and policymakers see Grangemouth as a casestudy in ensuring the transition from oil and gas is fair and just.\nSwinney said workers and local businesses faced “enormous difficulties”.\n“What we have to make sure is that we manage the transition from the dependence on fossil fuels to an approach that delivers net zero,” he said. “I think it can be done at scale [and] I’m confident we can deliver those new prospects for these communities.”\nHe was speaking after the UK and Scottish governments published a report from the consultancy EY that said up to 1,200 jobs could be created by attracting low-carbon businesses to Grangemouth. However, that would be too late for workers being laid off this year.\nEY identified nine industries including plastics recycling; biorefining of chemicals from organic waste; bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel production; biomethane production from organic waste; and low-carbon hydrogen from renewable sources and ammonia.\nThose industries would require substantial investment, the report said. About £3.5bn would be needed to create about 800 jobs over the next decade. As much as £7.5bn could be spent if those businesses expanded, to create 1,200 jobs by 2040.\nEarlier in March Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced £200m in UK government funding to help support five green businesses at Grangemouth; the Scottish government has put up £25m for a just transition fund.\nMichael Shanks, the UK government’s energy minister, chaired a local taskforce meeting with Gillian Martin, the Scottish government’s net zero secretary, on Wednesday morning. “We are committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth,” he said.\nEnergy analysts and environment campaigners are sceptical about some of these technologies, in particular mass production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, because they believe the costs and energy involved greatly outweigh the gains.\nBut Mark Simmers, chief executive of Celtic Renewables, a Grangemouth-based firm where Swinney launched the report, which is already making green chemicals, said he believed the plans were realistic.\nHis firm, which makes acetone, butanol and ethanol by fermenting whisky byproducts, waste potatoes and molasses, hopes to build a plant eight to 10 times larger than its current factory at the refinery site. Its products help make nail varnish, paints, medicines and household cleaning products, replacing crude oil-based chemicals.\n“We’ve got this great facility with a range of utilities, land and a lot of resources from a feed stocks perspective, but also from a people perspective,” Simmers said. “So repurposing that for a low carbon manufacturing complex, I think is a great and a realisable plan.”\nThe investment agency Scottish Enterprise would oversee possible investments, Swinney said. “This is going to take time. It’s going to take investment, and it’s going to take commitment, but the Scottish government is here for the long haul,” he said.",

      "content_en": "A Scottish judge has ruled that the deaths of three babies during childbirth could “realistically” have been avoided if maternity staff had been correctly trained.\nSheriff Principal Aisha Anwar KC said hospitals across Scotland should introduce a “trigger list” of early labour warning signs that would immediately lead to women being called in for hospital assessment.\nHospitals should also have a digital register and critical alert system for mothers who had previously had pre-term labour problems, a dedicated “red phone” in maternity units for emergency calls from ambulance crews, and improved handling of potentially difficult births.\nHer 11 recommendations followed a fatal accident inquiry, a Scottish process similar to an inquest but only called in particular cases, into the deaths of three babies in two hospitals in Lanarkshire in 2019 and 2021.\nThe circumstances of each death were different except that in all three, warning signs of a pre-term or difficult birth were not immediately acted on by hospital staff working for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.\nThe first involved Leo Lamont, who died two hours after birth in February 2019 after being born very prematurely. His mother had complained to the hospital of severe back pains but was told to take paracetamol; soon afterwards she gave birth in the bathroom at home.\nThree weeks later, Ellie McCormick died from oxygen starvation five hours after birth at a different hospital. Her mother told the ward by phone she was experiencing contractions; she was advised to take painkillers and call back if her waters broke or she was not coping.\nThree hours later she called, and was admitted to hospital for an emergency caesarean when staff found Ellie had a slow heart rate. The baby did not survive.\nIn the third case, in July 2021, Mira-Belle Bosch died 12 hours after birth owing to brain injuries from lack of oxygen during birth. Her mother had reported contractions and that her waters had broken three days earlier.\nShe said she was comfortable at home but two days later, her baby’s feet were presenting. Paramedics were unable to deliver the baby and it took them five attempts to reach the hospital maternity unit by phone. Mira-Belle was born in hospital but was unresponsive; her ventilator was switched off two days later.\nAnwar said: “The death of a child is an unimaginable and deeply painful event in an parent’s life, one from which it is undoubtedly difficult to recover.\n“The purpose of this inquiry is to understand what happened and what might be done in future to avoid such tragedy. I again offer my deepest condolences to the parents of Leo, Ellie and Mira-Belle.\n“Each gave evidence with great dignity and sought to assist the inquiry notwithstanding the anguish and heartache each has suffered.”\nIn a statement, the McCormick family said they could not have imagined the individual and system failures the inquiry brought to light.\n“What seemed to be flaws with the electronic system of record keeping actually turned out to be a catalogue of errors with numerous opportunities to avoid the tragic outcome that followed,” they said.\n“It was extremely difficult for the family to hear the evidence and reading the determination is bittersweet in terms of achieving some sense of closure but also learning once again how different things ought to have been.”",

It will be open 365 days a year.\nIn 2023, 1,172 Scots died from drug misuse – a quarter of those in Glasgow, which has been named Europe’s drugs death capital.\nLibby Brooks, the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent, speaks to staff at the Thistle about the services they are able to offer, and why they believe the service is vital in saving lives.\nShe says: “The population that the Thistle is dealing with, they are like the exemplar of hard to reach, right? They are people who have had, throughout their lives, really difficult experiences with conventional health services, with criminal justice, and so the Thistle is trying to connect with them in a very different way.\n“They are now seeing folk who perhaps haven’t been to a medical appointment, haven’t seen anyone official for two, three years, and the Thistle is the first time that they’ve actually felt able to make an approach for help, for treatment.”\nLibby tells Michael Safi why a political stalemate between the Scottish government and Westminster meant it took a decade for Glasgow city council to open the service, and the gradual shift towards a harm reduction approach in the UK.\nAlso, Councillor Allan Casey takes Libby around the neighbourhood to see public injection sites, and explains why they are so dangerous for drug users.\nSupport the Guardian today: theguardian.com/todayinfocuspod",

      "content_en": "A childhood friend of Noel Clarke saw one of the women accusing the former Doctor Who star of sexual misconduct grope him in a “playful” manner, the high court has heard.\nClarke, 49, is suing Guardian News and Media (GNM) for libel over seven articles and a podcast containing allegations of misconduct against him, published between April 2021 and March 2022.\nOne of the women who will give evidence for the Guardian is Gina Powell, a film producer and documentary maker, who worked for Clarke’s company Unstoppable Productions from 2014 to 2017.\nOn Monday, Philip Dore, who worked for Unstoppable from 2014 to 2015, said that he saw Powell grope Clarke at the premiere for the film Scottish Mussel at the Edinburgh festival in 2015.\nThe court heard that, in his witness statement, Dore had described Powell as touching his childhood friend “in a friendly way on his buttocks”.\nGavin Millar KC, representing GNM, said: “That’s not groping, is it?”\nDore replied: “If someone touches your buttocks, how else would you describe it? … She playfully touched his arse.”\nClarke previously told the court that Powell groped him on his bottom “multiple times” on a trip to Edinburgh.\nUnder cross-examination by Millar, Dore denied saying to Powell on a separate occasion that she was “asking for it” by wearing a short skirt and that she “shouldn’t wear short skirts around Noel”.\nHe also denied that when he met Powell in 2017 and heard that she had left Unstoppable, he had advised her “to leave quietly and keep her mouth shut”. Dore said: “I categorically did not tell Gina to keep her mouth shut.”\nDore told the court that Clarke had been “very protective” of Powell, treating her like “a little sister” because she was a woman working in the film industry, he knew one of her family and “wanted her to be treated with respect”.\nIt has emerged that at least five of the 15 people who were supposed to give oral evidence in support of Clarke’s claim will no longer be doing so.\nThey include the former EastEnders actor, Nabil Elouahabi, who was due to be cross-examined on Monday. The court heard he would no longer be appearing before it.\nSo far, nine witnesses have given oral evidence for Clarke, including Clarke himself. A summons to appear in court has been sent to a 10th witness Arnold Oceng, who appeared in Clarke’s films Brotherhood and Adulthood, but Millar said he was not living at his given address, nor had he responded to a WhatsApp message. The reasons for witnesses not appearing have not been disclosed in court.\nGNM’s witnesses, of whom there are 32 in total, will begin giving oral evidence on Tuesday. An application for GNM to add another witness, Anita (not her real name), was rejected by the judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, on Monday after Clarke’s legal team opposed it.\nMillar said Anita had come forward in response to media coverage of the trial.\nThe court heard that her proposed evidence included that Clarke put pressure on her to allow him to take an explicit photograph of her in a public place in Soho House, central London.\nSteyn said that while Anita’s evidence was “of some importance”, it was not critical given the other evidence available and could delay the trial.",

He said a ceasefire offer was now on the table, “Ukraine is serious about peace”, and it was now up to President Putin to decide how to respond. He said: Now it is Putin who stands in the spotlight, Putin who must answer, Putin who must choose. Are you serious, Mr Putin, about peace? Will you stop the fighting?

My warning to Mr. Putin is this – if you are serious, prove it with a full and unconditional ceasefire now. But Lammy said Putin did not seem interested in a ceasefire, and so the G7 was considering further action. If Putin does not deliver, and I must tell the house that I currently see no sign yet that he is, the G7 meeting helped us ready the tools to get Russia to negotiate seriously. We’re not waiting for the Kremlin. If they reject a ceasefire, we have more cards that we can play. We can all see the impact the G7’s unprecedented sanctions have had on Russia’s faltering economy; social spending down, inflation and interest rates sky high. There can be no let up in our efforts. In Canada we discussed where we can go further to target their energy and defence sectors, further squeeze their oil revenues and use frozen Russian assets.

Experts criticise Streeting for saying mental health problems overdiagnosed Read more According to polling by YouGov, almost four out of 10 people (37%) seem agree with Streeting that getting a diagnosis is too easy. But 32% say getting a diagnosis is too hard, and 14% say the balance is about right – meaning at last 46% don’t agree with Streeting. (Streeting talked about there being “overdiagnosis” of mental health conditions, whereas YouGov asked about it being “too easy” to get a diagnosis; the terms have different connotations, although roughly they imply the same thing.)

(See 9.31am.) She said: We are pleased to see pressure for a wealth tax growing, something the Green party has long argued for.

Stephen Timms, the social security and disability minister, replied: I recognise there has been a good deal of anxiety and I regret that that has occurred.

Share Updated at 12.39 EDT\n7d ago 12.22 EDT The urgent question is over, but Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, is now raising a point of order. Jenrick claims that Nicholas Dakin, the justice minister, misled MPs when he said the new Sentencing Council guidelines were approved by the last government. He says that the guidelines on which the last government was consulted were not the same as the ones finally published, because new wording was added, as the council itself admitted in its recent letter. The Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, objects, and tells Jenrick to accuse Dakin of inadvertently misleading the house. MPs are not allowed to accuse each other of being deliberately misleading, or lying. Dakin says he doesn’t think he inadvertenly misled MPs. Share\n7d ago 12.06 EDT Justice minister Nicholas Dakin says he's 'confident' that Sentencing Council will respond to government's concerns Desmond Swayne (Con) said the Sentencing Council row showed why it was a mistake for MPs “to delegate powers to quangos which then clearly come up with solutions which we find repulsive”. Dakin says, if Swayne had been present at the meeting last week, he would not have seen it as Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, just “asking” for a new approach. He says there was a constructive exchange of views and that a “proper process” is now in place, “which I am confident will come up with the right answer”. Share\n7d ago 12.01 EDT Josh Babarinde, the Lib Dem justice spokerperson, said two-tier justice already existed in the UK. He said the country used to be run by “two-tier Tories who thought they could get away with illegal number 10 parties, while the rest of us told to stay at home”. And he described Jenrick as a two-tier Tory “who unlawfully approved a development for his donor”. Share\n7d ago 11.56 EDT Andy Slaughter, the Labour chair of the Commons justice committee, spoke out in defence of the Sentencing Council. He said the new guidelines did not require pre-sentence reports to be obtained for offenders in the designated categories, including minority ethnic people, and did not prevent judges getting pre-sentence report for other people. Dakin said Slaughter was making a good point. Share\n7d ago 11.53 EDT Responding to Jenrick, Nicholas Dakin, the justice minister, said Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, met the Sentencing Council to discuss this dispute last week. He says they had a “constructive discussion” and Mahmood agreed to set out her objections in more detail in writing. The council agreed to consider those before the guidelines came into effect. Dakin said this process should be allowed to play out. Share\n7d ago 11.49 EDT Robert Jenrick uses urgent question to call for officials who drew up new Sentencing Council guidelines to be sacked Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, is now asking a Commons urgent question about the new Sentencing Council guidelines that he claims will create “two-tier justice”. He says the guidelines, which say judges should normally ask for pre-sentence reports when certain categories of offender, including minority ethnic offenders, are being sentenced. This violates the prinicple of equality before the law, he says. He says the people who draw up the guidelines should be sacked. He says the government should back his bill allowing the government to intervene. And he says he thinks Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary, is refusing to do this because she secretly agrees with the plans. Share",

      "content_en": "It’s late on a Saturday night in the tiny Scottish fishing village of Ullapool, well past 1am, and bass is pulsing out into the otherwise quiet streets from a quaking function room. This is Baile/Baile, possibly the most remote regular club night in the UK.\nLocated about 60 miles northwest of Inverness, and the same distance from the very top of mainland Scotland, Ullapool has long been an important hub for the surrounding villages. Despite only having a population of around 1,500, it has plenty of art studios, cafes, galleries and a museum. Plus, it’s home to a highly regarded school for traditional arts and Gaelic language. There’s an annual book festival and, from 2005 to 2019, there was a two-day music festival called Loopallu, headlined over the years by Mumford & Sons, Franz Ferdinand and Idlewild. The village is packed over summer thanks to the North Coast 500, a 516-mile scenic driving route around the northern peripheries of Scotland.\nUllapool has a history of dance culture, too. In the 1990s, a crew threw DIY raves in the area but, with funding cuts and an ageing population, Sigi Whittle, the co-founder of Baile/Baile who grew up locally, felt it was his turn to inject some life. “I was getting frustrated that things were tapering off,” he says. “There was a gap in the market and I wanted to give something back.”\nView image in fullscreen Panoramic views … a wholesome hike. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nLaunched in November 2023 by 28-year-old Whittle and his friend Jemima Fasakin, Baile means village in Gaelic and dance in Spanish. It brings established UK artists to the Highlands while giving much-needed opportunities to local DJs. During winter, Ullapool locks down, braced for the brutal weather, so Whittle and Fasakin (a Londoner living in Glasgow) decided to host their night from November to March. “The tourists leave,” Whittle says, “and the only people left are the people living in the village.”\nIt’s not just tourists who leave: the Highlands have a hard time retaining their youth. Cultural resources get funnelled to the cities, so young people like Whittle usually move out when they turn 18. He now lives in Edinburgh, where he works as a trainee architect, but his mum still lives in Ullapool. She often allows visiting DJs to sleep at her house.\nThe Baile/Baile venue, a family-run motel and function room called the Ceilidh Place, usually hosts traditional Gaelic music events, but tonight the 100-capacity space has transformed into a nightclub. Bouncer Alan Nutu, a local, is on security with hotel manager and sound engineer Gary Craig on lights and smoke machine. “We’ve had amazing DJs,” says the later. “People coming up from down south, wondering why they’ve never been here. It’s all been really positive.”\nKen McDonald (Dulcey to his friends) has dusted off the sound system he used for throwing raves in the 90s, while Whittle and Fasakin have hired decks from a club crew in Inverness. On the lineup are DADs, the Newcastle-based breaks and UK garage duo, plus Stevie Cox and Telford, house DJs and residents at Glasgow’s Sub Club.\nView image in fullscreen Sigi Whittle and Jemima Fasakin, co-founders of Baile/Baile. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nThis is the last event of the season and by 9.30pm the venue’s already filling up. Young men in bucket hats and sunglasses punch the air as Whittle (DJ Cablecar) and Fasakin (Jemima from the Bible) play their bass-heavy opening set. It’s a mixed crowd, with fresh-faced 18-year-olds dancing alongside folk in their 60s. About half are local, the other half having travelled from Glasgow, Edinburgh and London.\nBy 11pm, the venue’s at capacity and the energy is sky-high. The crowd’s locked in – there’s nowhere else to be tonight – and they dance unselfconsciously to DADs’ break-filled selection, a far cry from inner-city club standards. When Stevie Cox and Telford play their opening house track, a woman wearing LED-flashing trainers does a little dance routine next to the decks.\nJoseph Marsh has attended every Baile/Baile since its inception. “It’s brilliant for the community,” says the 24-year-old, whose parents used to attend Dulcey’s raves in the 90s. “I’ve grown up here and there’s been nothing. I just wish it happened more often.”\nThey’ve done such a good job, they’ve had to book an entire hostel to host people who travelled up for the weekend. On Friday night, about 50 revellers descend on Ullapool, packing out the nearby pub and emptying the chippy of haddock.\nView image in fullscreen Hardy souls … a dip at Ardmair. Photograph: Celine Antal/The Guardian\nOn Saturday, ravers hike up Meall Mhor, or Ullapool Hill, for panoramic views, while a few brave souls even go swimming. “It’s nice,” says Fasakin, “to have wholesomeness built into the weekend.”\nSaturday night is Baile/Baile and by 2am Stevie Cox and Telford are wrapping up their set with a techno banger. The venue is still at capacity, the punters packed in like sardines, and Whittle holds up the strobe light while Craig goes nuts with the smoke machine. When the music fades out, the crowd bursts into applause. Alan the bouncer thanks everyone as they file past, wishing them a safe journey home as they disperse into the silent village streets.",

Your article draws on the ill-will whipped up by some, but overlooks the evidence and the legacy of designation decisions made decades ago. It quotes statistics from our health check report, but what isn’t mentioned is the finding that nature decline in national parks is happening in spite of the designation, not because of it. The key conclusion of the report is that national parks need greater power and funding in the face of the global climate and biodiversity crisis.\nIn Scotland, national parks are leading the way – Cairngorms Connect is the UK’s largest habitat restoration across 600 square kilometres. And evidence from Scottish Environment Link found that the two Scottish national parks generate more than £700m per year, investing in nature, landscape and community regeneration, supporting hundreds of jobs directly and thousands through the wider economy.\nThe UK’s first national park was established in 1951 in the Peak District by a postwar government that could see the power in protecting the nation’s finest landscapes, investing in public health and wellbeing, and regenerating rural communities. The true benefit and purpose of national park designation is to create a legacy. The challenge facing a government designating new national parks is in creating the space for informed and curious debate, focusing on what unites us rather than divides us.\nDr Rose O’Neill\nChief executive, Campaign for National Parks",

The Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said that was 8C hotter than the average for the time of year.\n“We’re expecting quite a lot of dry weather, increasing amounts of sunshine as we head through the next few days,” she said. “By Wednesday, we’re looking at highs of about 17C in the south. And then on Thursday, we could get as high as 19C.”\nThat temperature is estimated to be hotter than in Ibiza, which is forecast to have highs of 17C on Thursday, while Corfu is forecast to have highs of 16C.\nHowever, the start of the week in the UK will still feel chilly, with some overnight frost, the forecaster said.\n“So the temperatures we have got currently are around average, which is about 10C. But we’ve also got quite a chilly wind at the moment, so it’s making it feel even colder,” Mitchell said.\n“But by the time we get to Wednesday and Thursday, temperatures will be about eight degrees above average in some places. The spring equinox will coincide with some nice warm weather, definitely feeling spring-like.”\nThe expected higher temperatures will be due to a large area of high pressure, which tends to bring dry and sunny weather.\nThe warmest air will be in southern parts of the UK, Mitchell said.\n“Parts of the south-east [and] across the Midlands will be the warmest spots on Wednesday, and then on Thursday that warmth travels a bit further north, so it’s going to feel pretty warm across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland and the whole of England and Wales.\n“There’s really just northern Scotland that will keep hold of the colder weather through the middle of the week.”",

In a 30-minute round trip, visitors can rub the nose of Greyfriars Bobby, spit on the Heart of Midlothian and touch David Hume’s toe, all thought to bring good luck. On the way, they might stop for a selfie with Wojtek the Bear, an honorary member of the Polish army who went on to live in Edinburgh Zoo, while the Scott Monument, built to honour Sir Walter, looms overhead.\nAccording to campaigners, though, there is something missing: women. There are no freestanding statues of women in the city centre, and only a handful in the surrounding area. So when a fundraiser was launched in 2017 to secure a Royal Mile statue for Elsie Inglis, Scottish suffragist and maternal health pioneer, it quickly gained momentum. But when plans were finally unveiled last month, a bitter row was reignited about the choice of a male sculptor and his vision for the statue.\nThe dispute began in 2022 when the charity Statue For Elsie Inglis suddenly cancelled an open call for designs by artists for the future monument, and instead announced the appointment of Alexander Stoddart, who holds the title of the King’s Sculptor in Ordinary in Scotland and whose existing works include five statues in Edinburgh city centre, two of them – of David Hume and Adam Smith – on the Royal Mile. The backlash was so forceful that all but one of the charity’s trustees resigned.\nView image in fullscreen A sketch of the proposed monument to Dr Elsie Inglis on the southern pavement of the Royal Mile.

Among those who have objected is Margaret Graham, Labour councillor for the proposed site, who told the Observer the design was “dowdy and not representative of the character of Elsie Inglis”. She called for further public consultation before a final decision was made.\nNatasha Phoenix, a feminist sculptor and campaigner who led opposition to Stoddart’s appointment in 2022, said the commission was “a cultural embarrassment” and should have been given to a woman. Stoddart, she said, has “no links to feminism or to Elsie Inglis”.\nPhoenix, who had planned to enter the original competition before it was closed, said: “It’s incredibly important that women’s stories are told through the female gaze. When men create sculptures of women, they often portray them through the patriarchal lens, whether intentionally or not.”\nInglis, one of the first women to graduate from Edinburgh University, founded a free hospital and milk bank for Edinburgh’s poorest women and children, and was active in the suffrage movement. When war broke out in 1914, she established a fleet of women-run field hospitals and served as a medic for three years.\nThe Inglis statue is set to be located at the site of her maternity hospital but Stoddart’s proposed design, revealed last month, depicts her in military uniform, standing upright and alone on a tall pedestal.\nPhoenix said the design “erases women’s history and lacks qualities attributed to Elsie – warmth, compassion and spirit. She existed among everyday folks and, figuratively, would never have put herself on a pedestal or above others.” Instead, Phoenix suggested, the statue should depict Inglis in a caring stance alongside a new, breastfeeding mother.\nDr Lynn McNair, a lecturer in early education at the University of Edinburgh, said she also objected and called for a child-friendly design instead of one “out of reach, physically and in representation”.\n“As a parent and educator, I’ve walked countless times up and down the High Street with a little hand tucked in mine, and I’ve seen first-hand how public art sparks children’s imagination, ignites questions and deepens their understanding of the world,” she said. “We had a chance to honour Elsie Inglis in a way that reflected her fight for women’s voices to be heard. Instead, we risk telling another story where those voices remain absent.”\nGemma Bone, a member of a Facebook group set up to campaign against the proposals, said she felt Stoddart was “an establishment male sculptor … whose agenda is to put a classical-style sculpture in a prominent place”, and that “[Inglis’s] military service, serving men, was small compared to her pioneering medical work for women and babies”.\nFor others, the issue is one of transparency. Jenny Lester, chair of Edinburgh’s International Women’s Day march, said Stoddart’s selection had been “in bad faith”.\n“For me, the problem isn’t that he’s a man but that he was selected by the trust after they said it would be a competitive process,” she added.\nAlexander Stoddart and Edinburgh council were approached for comment.\nTrustees of Statue For Elsie Inglis said in a statement that the submission of the planning application was “a significant milestone in the project to deliver a lasting tribute on the Royal Mile”.\n“The trustees continue to be committed to the delivery of this project and we hope all those who recognise the life and work of Dr Elsie Inglis will be supportive,” they said.\nBut for their opponents, the differences will be difficult to reconcile. “There are already dozens of boring, patriarchal statues on the Royal Mile that everyone walks straight past,” said one.\n“It’s an insult to Elsie and all of us to make her into another one.”\nMary Wollstonecraft\nIn 2020, Maggi Hambling’s sculpture of feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft was met with criticism when it depicted her nude and as an unrecognisable “everywoman” figure. Its unveiling followed a decade-long fundraising effort by the Mary on the Green campaign, whose representatives defended the design as a modern and challenging depiction – but feminist activist Caroline Criado-Perez called it “insulting” and “a naked, perfectly formed, wet dream of a woman”.\nMillicent Fawcett\nA statue of suffragist leader Millicent Fawcett, by Turner prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing, was erected in Parliament Square after a campaign. But a few years after its unveiling in 2018, a book by professor Melissa Terras claimed the words depicted on the statue, “courage calls to courage everywhere”, had been taken out of context. Widely cited as a tribute to suffragette Emily Davison, Terras said Fawcett had not actually penned the line until years after Davison’s death, and only then to explain why her death had attracted widespread attention, rather than to celebrate her.\nVirginia Woolf\nLast year, a bust of writer Virginia Woolf in Bloomsbury was the subject of a dispute after Camden council labelled it with a QR code directing viewers to an explanation of Woolf’s “imperialist views”. The move was part of a project established in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests to “make meaningful connections between our diverse communities and Camden’s public realm,” the council said. Woolf’s great-niece Emma Woolf slammed the decision, calling Camden council “the wokerati”.",

      "content_en": "When Vishal Sharma, an experienced merchant seaman, arrived in London from India in November 2017, he was looking forward to a good job on a Belgian tanker, the MT Waasmunster, assisting engineers. He had a 15-month contract and a transit visa, enabling him to travel to Milford Haven in Wales, where the 174-metre vessel was anchored.\nBut in a last-minute change of plan, his Mumbai agent told him to head to Southwick in West Sussex, England, to board a scallop trawler, the Noordzee.\nSomething was wrong, he felt, but his agent said he would be dropped at the tanker. Sharma tried to discuss it with the captain of the Noordzee. “I told him, ‘This is not my ship. I am not a fisherman.’” He could no longer reach his agent, as there was no wifi network onboard.\n“I felt alone and afraid,” says Sharma, 32.\nAt sea, there was no easy way out. He was threatened with deportation if he did not work, he says.\n“They told me, ‘We will call the police, you don’t have the right documents, you will go to jail.’”\n“It is very dangerous work,” he says. “You can’t argue with the captain, when the ship is rolling and pitching. Anything could happen. You are at sea. It is scary.”\nI wanted to stay in the UK until I got justice Vishal Sharma\nFor the next three weeks, he worked 18 to 20 hours a day, without safety equipment or proper meals, he claims. He had little access to the bathroom and developed urinary problems, he says.\nHis ordeal ended after he was transferred on to another boat, where other migrant fishers had reported being exploited and mistreated to police. When the boat docked at Portsmouth, immigration officers were waiting and Sharma and the others were taken to a police station. “The police said to me, can you explain everything that has happened to you? They said, ‘We are with you. You are in the UK, a safe country.’”\nSharma was recognised as a victim of modern slavery by the Home Office and agreed to help police by giving evidence in a criminal case. “I wanted to stay in the UK until I got justice,” he says.\nSharma appeared on a BBC documentary, Disclosure: Slavery at Sea, which broadcast in 2024. The BBC, which also ran a radio documentary on the issue, revealed he was one of 35 men who worked on vessels owned by TN Trawlers and its sister companies, owned by the Nicholson family, and were recognised as victims of modern slavery between 2012 and 2020.\nBut justice has been elusive. TN Trawlers and its associated companies were the subject of two lengthy criminal investigations, but no cases of human trafficking or modern slavery have come to trial, although some of the men waited years to give evidence.\nThe Crown Office in Scotland acknowledges that Sharma is a victim of a crime. But the criminal investigation into what happened to him was dropped after he could not identify the perpetrators in a video.\nNow, after years of helping the authorities in Scotland, Sharma is facing deportation back to India, where he fears his life is in danger. Word got back to his agents in Mumbai that he had spoken to the police, he claims. His father was assaulted by the agents, he says, and he has received death threats. He has suffered bouts of depression.\nView image in fullscreen Vishal and Sukhdeep Sharma at home in Bradford with their son, Humraj. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer\nWhile in this legal limbo, he has built a life for himself in Bradford. He worked fitting shop fronts and married Sukhdeep, 27, a business student and Indian national. In December 2020, they had a son, Humraj.\n“She’s my wife, my best friend, she has given me moral support,” he says.\nIn a letter sent to Sharma and his family in February, the Home Office rejected their asylum claims and told them to leave the UK. It said: “It is considered that any subjective fear you may have of returning to India is not objectively well-founded.”\nJoy Gillespie, the CEO of Survivors of Human Trafficking in Scotland, an NGO that has supported many of the 35 migrant fishers who appeared on the BBC’s documentary, says: “These men have done everything they could to help make a prosecution happen. But when it doesn’t work out, they are of no value and they are left in the lurch. If we are to bring these difficult trafficking prosecutions, we have to be more victim focused and give them our support.”\nChris Williams, of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), says fishing is a “blind spot” for potential labour exploitation of migrant workers. The system ties them to one vessel, where they are at the mercy of the skipper.\n“Unfortunately, what happened to Vishal and others could happen again,” Williams says. The ITF is calling for fishers to be included in the Fair Work Agency, a new state enforcement agency being proposed in the government’s employment rights bill going through parliament.\nView image in fullscreen The BBC documentary Slavery at Sea featured migrant workers who worked on vessels owned by TN Trawlers and its sister companies. Photograph: BBC\nStephanie Hill and Carolin Ott, solicitors for Leigh Day, are investigating a number of claims for other exploited migrant fishers.\n“We are concerned that the exploitation of migrant fishers and seafarers for the purposes of forced labour and other forms of modern slavery are not being properly investigated by the police and the Home Office, who have a duty to investigate instances and risks of trafficking and forced labour,” they say.\nOn Sharma’s case, a spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service says: “The case was carefully considered and a decision was taken that we could not prosecute due to insufficient evidence. The findings of an independent review supported the original decision. Further areas of investigation were identified and are under consideration.”\nA spokesperson for the Home Office says the government is determined to tackle “the scourge of modern slavery” but adds: “The right to claim asylum in the UK is an entirely separate process from the support an individual may be entitled to as a victim of modern slavery.”\nThe Guardian was told that TN Trawlers no longer exists. A legal representative of the TN group said they did not wish to comment on this article.\nLast year, a spokesperson for TN Group told the BBC it disputed suggestions that workers were mistreated or were victims of modern slavery.\nThe spokesperson said it always provided food and accommodation to workers and that they were “always free to come and go when ashore”.\n“The overwhelming experience of our workers was that they were well treated and well remunerated. We dispute many of the accounts put to us, in some cases over a decade on.\n“We absolutely refute any allegation of modern slavery or human trafficking and our many testimonials and long-term employees are testament to that.”",

      "content_en": "Nicola Sturgeon must be sick of the sight of her own obituaries. Since she confirmed on Wednesday that she will not seek re-election as a MSP at next May’s Holyrood elections, ending a 27-year career in frontline politics, the Scottish media has overflowed with assessments of the legacy and greatest hits of the country’s first female and longest serving first minister.\nAlthough the decision came as no surprise, given her increasingly infrequent appearances at the Scottish parliament, her departure seems a good time to consider what she did and the imprint she has left on the recent history and future trajectory of her country.\nHaving reported on Sturgeon for over a decade, I remember the deafening roars of the crowd at Glasgow’s 12,000-seater Hydro arena, which she sold out in 2014 – like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé – a few weeks after her election as SNP leader. I remember a round table on energy policy, where she made sure that the only young woman in the room got a chance to speak. I remember her reddening face and wobbly lip last year as she struggled to contain her emotion under questioning at the UK Covid-19 inquiry.\nAn introvert with down-to-earth charm, she was – and still is among many in the SNP and the wider Scottish public – adored, a progressive ally and advocate in private as well as public. Her greatest gift is the ability to speak human when all around her just look to be touting for votes.\nAt the age of 54 – with eight years on our prime minister and still relatively young in terms of political careers – talk of legacy can feel premature. It is certainly fluid, with the Branchform inquiry into SNP finances, which saw her arrested a few months after she resigned as first minister in 2023, ongoing and her soon to be ex-husband, Peter Murrell, charged with alleged embezzlement.\nSince her announcement, posted on her current favoured social media platform, Instagram, the Holyrood opposition has taken the opportunity to cast her legacy as one dominated by division and failure. But that is less than half the story.\nCertainly Sturgeon benefited electorally from the Yes/No split that followed the 2014 referendum, with independence voters uniting behind the SNP, and supporters of the union split between other parties. It took another 10 years for the link between constitutional preference and ballot box to uncouple, resulting in the SNP’s catastrophic defeat in last July’s general election at the hands of a resurgent Scottish Labour. (Since then, Labour has squandered its advantage and the SNP is leading the polls for Holyrood again.)\nBut her own political standing suffered because of that same division – those who loved her were unwilling to hold her to account, while those who loathed her refused to acknowledge her many assets.\nIt was this capacity to polarise that Sturgeon herself identified as one of her reasons for stepping down as first minister. But it was plain that she was also spent after a gruelling run of challenges, including the Covid pandemic, the Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish government’s handling of sexual assault allegations against her predecessor Alex Salmond, and the controversy around her flagship gender recognition reforms.\nThroughout the pandemic, Sturgeon was admired across the UK for her straightforward and reassuring communication, yet the UK Covid inquiry exposed a significant lack of transparency behind this, bypassing cabinet decision-making and mass deletion of informal messages. It underlined her hyper-controlled, presidential style of leadership and its brutal self-imposed toll, with Sturgeon unable to allow herself even a day off.\nWith the Salmond inquiry – as with her husband and former SNP chief executive Murrell – some felt a woman was being unfairly held responsible for the alleged actions of a man – but self-evidently this woman was also in charge of her government and at the epicentre of party decision-making for decades. Likewise, both she and Murrell failed to recognise the almighty potential conflict that having a married couple at the head of a governing party represented.\nShe was badly hurt by accusations of betraying feminism over her gender recognition reforms, which she could not have foreseen would coalesce around a global culture war when she first proposed them as a natural progression from the introduction of equal marriage. But her refusal to entertain those, even within her own party, worried about the potential scope of self-identification left her exposed.\nSturgeon herself has said the introduction of the Scottish child payment, the expansion of free childcare and support for youngsters in care are among her proudest achievements. Critics point to failures to tackle the attainment gap or drug deaths, timidity in taking on vested interests over NHS reform, and also her unwillingness to build on the broad coalition gifted by the Yes movement after the referendum.\nSomething that even admirers of Sturgeon have always wrestled with was the space between rhetoric and reality in the SNP government – or, as an anti-poverty campaigner said to me: “Does it matter that witches have been pardoned if you don’t know what you’re going to feed your child tomorrow?” Despite some excellent policy progress on violence against women and child poverty, for example, third sector leaders would highlight a significant implementation gap: like the extended childcare, which ended up a postcode lottery, with extra hours at work-unfriendly times.\nSpeaking to younger activists, it’s clear that the sheer symbolism of Sturgeon’s tenure inspired generations. Her legacy is as much in what she made visible and normal. She proved it was possible to govern in an entirely different tone of voice from the Tory bombast at Westminster: speaking out against Trump, happily describing herself as a feminist, championing the transformative power of reading. She spoke too about miscarriage, the menopause, fostering – and while having a political leader talk about those topics on Loose Women is not a silver bullet to systemic inequality, it mattered.\nPerhaps it was inevitable that the first of her kind would end up unable to fulfil the weight of expectation. It is worth keeping in mind too that the party she led is united by its desire for independence, not centre-left social policy.\nFor now, Sturgeon’s Instagram followers can see her enjoying the “ordinary stuff that most people take for granted”, which she referenced in her resignation speech as having become increasingly out of her reach. Although for Sturgeon this involves hanging out with the tartan A-list, DJing with Hollywood star Alan Cumming and hosting books events with her old pal and crime-writing doyenne Val McDermid.\nMeanwhile, those obituary writers – me included – await the publication of her “deeply personal” memoir later this year with some anticipation about the revelations it may contain. I doubt these will be the last words to be written about a woman who continues to fascinate, infuriate, inspire and challenge even as she steps – for now – out of the limelight.",

      "content_en": "The Government has confirmed the first recorded case of bird flu (H5N1) being transmitted to a sheep has been found in England.\nThe transmission, which was confirmed after multiple positive milk tests, was found on a farm where bird flu had previously been detected in captive birds.\nThe discovery comes after an outbreak of bird flu in cows in the US.\nHowever, the government says there is no evidence of an increased risk to Britain’s livestock.\nAnimal owners have been urged to stay vigilant and report any signs of illness to the Animal and Plant Health Agency.\nUK Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: “We have confirmed the detection of influenza of avian origin (H5N1) in a single sheep on a farm in Yorkshire. Strict biosecurity measures have been implemented to prevent the further spread of disease.\n“While the risk to livestock remains low, I urge all animal owners to ensure scrupulous cleanliness is in place and to report any signs of infection to the Animal Plant Health Agency immediately.”\nDr Meera Chand, Emerging Infection Lead at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “Globally, we continue to see that mammals can be infected with avian influenza A(H5N1).\n“However, current evidence suggests that the avian influenza viruses we’re seeing circulating around the world do not spread easily to people – and the risk of avian flu to the general public remains very low.”\nITV News provides essential details about how the virus transmits to humans.\nHow bird flu spreads to humans\nBird flu is spread through close contact with an infected bird, whether dead or alive, according to the NHS. This can happen through:\nTouching infected birds\nHandling droppings or bedding\nPreparing infected poultry for cooking\nYou cannot catch bird flu by eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas with an outbreak.\nHow to Reduce the Risk\nIf visiting a country with an outbreak:\nWash hands often with warm water and soap, especially before and after handling food\nUse separate utensils for raw and cooked meat\nEnsure meat is cooked thoroughly until steaming hot\nAvoid contact with live birds and poultry\nWhat to Avoid\nDo not touch bird droppings or sick or dead birds\nAvoid live animal markets or poultry farms\nDo not bring live birds, poultry, or feathers back to the UK\nAvoid eating undercooked poultry, duck, or raw eggs\nSymptoms of Bird Flu in Humans\nSymptoms usually appear within 3 to 5 days and can include:\nHigh temperature or feeling feverish\nMuscle aches\nHeadache\nCough or shortness of breath\nOther possible symptoms:\nDiarrhoea, nausea, or stomach pain\nChest pain\nBleeding from the nose or gums\nConjunctivitis (eye infection)\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "The average price of a pint of beer is set to surge past £5 for the first time due to cost hikes hitting the sector next month, according to industry bosses.\nPub sector chiefs have warned that prices for customers will have to increase in order to help keep venues running in the face of higher labour costs.\nThe British Beer and Pub Association said the average cost of a pint in the UK is expected to rise by around 21p as a result.\nThe research, commissioned alongside Frontier Economics, showed that pub firms are expecting to raise the average price of a pint from £4.80 to £5.01.\nThis comes amid a raft of cost increases linked to last October’s budget, which will come into force in April.\nFirms will face increases to the national minimum wage, a rise in national insurance rates and a decrease in the threshold at which firms start paying out national insurance.\nBusiness rates discounts for firms in the sector will also be cut from 75% to 40% from April.\nThe net cost of autumn budget announcements across the beer and pub sector is approximately £650 million in total, the trade body said.\nIt comes after historic brewer Shepherd Neame – which makes ales including Spitfire and Bishops Finger – said earlier this week that it will hike its beer prices in response to rising taxes.\nEmma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said: “The cumulative impact of these taxes and regulations is now plain to see and it is highly unfortunate that the only way many pubs can remain viable is to pass on the array of upcoming costs to consumers.\n“No one wants to see the cost of an average pint increase by a further 21p and break the £5 average pint barrier that will be required for pubs to maintain their punishingly slim profit margins.\n“It is more urgent than ever that Government looks at ways to cap or reduce the costs of doing business so we can keep pubs open, preserve their community value, and make sure the price of a pint remains affordable for all.”\nTim Black, associate director at Frontier Economics, said: “The beer and pub sector has shown real resilience through a tough few years – navigating the pandemic, the energy crisis, and the cost-of-living squeeze.\n“But more headwinds are coming.\n“The sector is at the sharp end of a wave of policy changes that will push up costs – higher wages, increased national insurance, reduced business rates relief, and new packaging rules. The cumulative impact will be significant.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Heathrow Airport had “enough power” from remaining substations despite Friday’s shutdown, the chief executive of National Grid has said.\nJohn Pettigrew said two substations were “always available for the distribution network companies and Heathrow to take power”.\nFlights were halted after a fire knocked out an electricity substation in Hayes on Thursday evening, and were not able to resume until Friday evening.\nIn his first comments since the disruption, Mr Pettigrew told the Financial Times: “There was no lack of capacity from the substations.\n“Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow.”\nThe chief executive of the electricity and gas utility company added: “Two substations were always available for the distribution network companies and Heathrow to take power.\n“Losing a substation is a unique event — but there were two others available.\n“So that is a level of resilience.”\nIn response to the comments, a Heathrow Airport spokesperson said: “As the National Grid’s chief executive, John Pettigrew, noted, he has never seen a transformer failure like this in his 30 years in the industry.\n“His view confirms that this was an unprecedented incident and that it would not have been possible for Heathrow to operate uninterrupted.\n“Hundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted. Given Heathrow’s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.”\nHeathrow chief executive Thomas Woldbye had said a back-up transformer failed during the power outage, meaning systems had to be closed in accordance with safety procedures so power supplies could be restructured from two remaining substations.\nA report by consultancy firm Jacobs more than 10 years ago found a “key weakness” of Heathrow’s electricity supply was “main transmission line connections to the airport”.\nThe document, published in 2014, stated “outages could cause disruption to passenger, baggage and aircraft handling functions”, and “could require closure of areas of affected terminals or potentially the entire airport”.\nIn its appraisal of operational risk at the airport, Jacobs said provision of on-site generation and other measures to ensure resilient supply appeared “to be adequate” to enable Heathrow “to withstand and recover from interruptions to supply”.\nIt added that the airport operated “within risk parameters that are not excessive or unusual for an airport of its type”.\nEnergy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered the National Energy System Operator to “urgently investigate” the power outage caused by the substation fire, and is working with Ofgem and using powers under the Energy Act to formally launch the grid operator’s investigation.\nThe National Energy System Operator (Neso) is expected to report to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero and Ofgem with initial findings within six weeks.\nCounter-terrorism officers from the Metropolitan Police initially led the investigation, but the force said the fire is not believed to be suspicious so London Fire Brigade is now leading the probe which will focus on the electrical distribution equipment.\nMeanwhile, an internal review of the airport’s crisis management plans and its response to Friday’s power outage will be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow’s board.\nA Heathrow spokesperson said: “In line with our airline partners, our objective was to reopen as soon as safely and practically possible after the fire.\n“The emergency services and hundreds of airport colleagues worked tirelessly throughout Friday to ensure the safe reopening of the airport.\n“Their success meant that over the weekend, we were able to focus on operating a full schedule of over 2500 flights and serving over 400,000 passengers.”\nBritish Airways said it was expecting to run a “near-full schedule” on Sunday and passengers should go to the west London airport as normal unless told otherwise.\nThe airline said it operated about 90% of its scheduled flights on Saturday when Heathrow said it was “open and fully operational”.\nHeathrow is Europe’s largest airport, with more than 83.9 million passengers travelling through its terminals in 2024, and around 200,000 passengers were affected by Friday’s closure.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Almost half of Scottish adults would support the idea of charging university tuition fees based on the ability to pay with funding focused on those who need it most, according to a report.\nThe report, published by the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland and based on polling by Ipsos UK, sought the public’s views on the value, accessibility and funding of higher education.\nThe authors said it showed widespread support for some form of help with the cost of tuition fees, but opinions were divided on the extent and scope of the kind of help offered.\nOut of the 1,057 people over the age of 18 interviewed, 44% expressed the view the Scottish Government should continue to support all first-time undergraduates, while 43% said they would prefer those whose households could afford it to pay at least some of their tuition fees.\nFour in 10 respondents (43%) agreed that too many people in Scotland continue to face barriers to going to university, with those from low-income households (65%) and disadvantaged backgrounds (55%) considered most likely to experience barriers.\nAsked where the Scottish Government should prioritise post-school education funding, 61% of respondents backed apprenticeship places, followed by grants or bursaries for low-income and disadvantaged students to cover the cost of living (50%).\nUpskilling and retraining for adults on low incomes and supporting people who face barriers to university were prioritised by 43% and 29% respectively, while just over a quarter (26%) felt that funding all first-time undergraduate tuition fees should be a priority.\nOverall, the report found almost half of Scottish adults (46%) supported the idea of charging university tuition fees based on the ability to pay, and less than a third (29%) said they would not back such a move.\nThe Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland, which was established in 1901 to support individuals who faced financial barriers to access higher education, is now commissioning a Citizen Jury to consider evidence on the subject of higher education funding and make recommendations.\nIt comes at a time when universities are facing funding pressures, linked in part to falling numbers of overseas students.\nMeanwhile the Scottish Government insists it will not move away from its commitment for university tuition to remain free for Scottish students.\nCarnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland chief executive Hannah Garrow said: “We know how complex the higher education funding system is and how much rides on it.\n“However, recent discussions on how to finance higher education feel like they are stuck on repeat, while for many people funding continues to be seen as a barrier to access.\n“This research shows that there is room for a more nuanced and open discussion on priorities for funding.\n“If politicians are struggling to come up with solutions, perhaps the public can inject some democratic innovation into the debate.\n“The government has already committed to lead the development of a new funding model, so understanding the views of the public as beneficiaries and users of the system is critical.\n“We hope that the Scottish Government and all political parties in Scotland will get behind our Citizen Jury and commit to giving its outcomes careful consideration.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Donna McDonald tried Botox for the first time after being drawn in by a social media advert offering the cosmetic procedure at a bargain price.\nBut what she received turned out to be bogus.\nThe procedure left her with a huge infection and lumps on both sides of her face.\n“It was almost too good to be true, and that should have been the sign, to be honest,” Donna told STV News.\n“There was a lot of bleeding after I’d had it done, I felt blood trickling down my face during it too – then my face swelled up into a boil type thing.\n“I’m scarred for life now. There’s nothing I can do about that.”\nDonna felt embarrassed and delayed going to the GP, but she was left with no choice when her symptoms didn’t improve.\nShe added: “They suspect it’s an infection, a rare infection, and the treatment will involve months and months of antibiotics. If it’s just my face rejecting whatever has been put into it, I could possibly need steroid injections, which could lead to more scarring.\n“I also had to get blood tests done to make sure I didn’t catch HIV or hepatitis.\n“It’s unbelievable.”\nThe business of Botox and dermal fillers is booming – but concerns over safety are also increasing.\nThere is no legislation to stop unqualified individuals from administering these treatments despite Botox being a prescription-only medication.\nAs a result, there has been a surge in unregulated “Botox parties”, where alcohol and social settings blur the line between cosmetic procedures and risky behaviour.\nFor many, the cheap options seem too good to pass up, but the consequences can be life-changing.\nProfessionals working in the sector say they see cases like Donna’s on a daily basis.\nCosmetic surgeon and campaigner Dr Darren McKeown has accused ministers of turning a blind eye.\nHe said: “We know the people administering the treatments in these places have no medical qualifications. We know that very often patients are treated without seeing a prescriber, so there is no valid prescription for the medications they are being treated with, often without prescriptions, and there is no other country in Europe that allows non-healthcare professionals to perform these procedures.”\nDr McKeown believes the lack of regulation has led to an explosion of cosmetic cowboys, who are now deeply embedded in Scotland’s £400m beauty industry.\nAnd the rise of so-called Botox parties – isn’t helping.\nHe said: “No regulated healthcare professional would ever perform treatments in the context of a party setting. It’s not safe, it’s not ethical, and frankly, it’s a disgrace that it’s allowed to go on in Scotland unchallenged.”\nThe Scottish Government has recently concluded a consultation on regulating the non-surgical cosmetic procedures industry and clarifying who can and cannot carry them out.\nJenni Minto, minister for public health and women’s health, told STV News she’s seeking to put forward legislation that is both “robust” and “future proof”.\nShe said: “Every piece of legislation is a balancing act, which is why it’s so important to engage with those who are providing the services, as well as those accessing the services.\n“We have to get it right, you can’t just bring legislation in quickly – you have to have the right evidence and support.”\nAs the debate continues, the public is urged to remain vigilant when seeking cosmetic treatments.\nHealthcare Improvement Scotland has called on everyone to check whether their chosen clinic is registered and regulated to ensure their safety.\nAll private clinics, hospitals, and hospices where healthcare professionals provide services are legally required to register with the organisation.\nEddie Docherty, director of quality assurance and regulation at Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said: “Having a cosmetic treatment is a serious undertaking that should only be entered into with due consideration of the very real risks to an individual’s health and safety.\n“Bringing together the injecting of Botox, alcohol, and a party atmosphere reduces people’s judgement and their ability to properly provide consent and consider the real risks.\n“No clinic regulated by us, and run by a healthcare professional, would be permitted to run Botox parties as an appropriate environment to provide such a treatment.\n“We would urge anyone looking to get cosmetic interventions to think about their health and wellbeing, and put their care into the hands of professionals with years of appropriate training and experience behind them, and where they can trust them to make their wellbeing a priority.\n“In addition, if you are receiving Botox from a beautician, then it may be a product that has been imported from overseas and not authorised for use in the UK.\n“Only a trained and experienced healthcare professional should administer Botox, acquired through a registered pharmacist, as they can access it legally, understand the physiology of the face in order to administer it correctly, and have ready access to effective medicines if something goes wrong.”\nHe added: “People should always check that a clinic is registered with Healthcare Improvement Scotland before undertaking treatments.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

They controlled the game even when we had the ball, so we need to do more in that sense as well.”\nThe Scots went into Sunday’s second leg buoyed by a three-match winning streak and a four-game unbeaten run in which they had conceded only one goal.\nMcLean, who won his 50th cap, admitted they need to sharpen up significantly over the summer as they prepare to face Greece again in their 2026 World Cup qualification campaign later this year.\n“Especially the way we’ve been going and the way we’ve always acquitted ourselves, I think when you do put a performance in so disappointing, it does surprise you a bit,” said McLean.\n“It’s one we need to learn from, because we play Greece in the World Cup qualifiers, so we now know how good they are.\n“They are a really good team, but as I said, we gave them a lot tonight. We’ve got a couple of games in the summer (against Iceland and Liechtenstein) that we can really work together and try and get better and improve.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Scotland head coach Steve Clarke hopes there is a silver lining from their heavy home defeat by Greece after appearing to learn immediate lessons.\nClarke’s side were relegated from the top tier of the Nations League after losing 3-0 in their play-off second leg at Hampden.\nScotland had gone into the game on a high after winning 1-0 in the away leg on Thursday but they were two down on aggregate inside 46 minutes and never looked like getting back into the game.\nRyan Christie returned from suspension to replace Lewis Ferguson but Clarke otherwise kept the same team that played in Piraeus while Greece made six changes including handing a debut to 17-year-old goalscorer Konstantinos Karetsas, whose half-time introduction had inspired Greece on Thursday.\n“We didn’t have enough energy in the team,” Clarke said. “Greece had more energy. They were a little bit sharper. The best team won on the night.”\nScotland also travel to Greece in the World Cup qualifiers on November 15 and Clarke hinted he would look at making more changes before their final group game at Hampden three days later.\nWhen asked if he might have freshened things up more, Clarke said: “It’s possible. With hindsight, everything’s possible. The boys assured me they were all fit and well.\n“I think the first goal gave them a lift. Their first dangerous foray forward, they scored with that. After that, it became a long night for us. I could have done with a few more legs on the team, to be honest.\n“It might work in our favour, actually, because we have to do a similar trip in November out to Greece.\n“It may be something to look at, the fact that you go out there, you put in a big shift out there, you have the long travel back. Maybe we weren’t quite recovered in time for the game. Not everybody, but some people.\n“It’s something that I can certainly look at and try and address.”\nScotland started on the front foot with Scott McTominay looking dangerous but a lack of tracking back cost them as they conceded two first-half goals. A loose pass from Christie then gifted Greece a third.\nClarke said: “I thought the back four did reasonably OK. I was disappointed with the defending of the team. We defended as a team from back to front on Thursday night in Greece. We didn’t do that in this game and that’s why we got punished.”\nClarke added: “Greece came here and laid down a marker. We know what to expect when they come back in October. We’ll be ready.\n“To finish such a positive Nations League campaign on such a low note and such a poor performance is something that will hurt the players. We’ve got plenty of time to stew on it before our next competitive game.\n“We’ve got two friendlies in June. We have to address one or two things and try to be better going forward.”\nIt was a record fifth consecutive away win for Greece, whose starting line-up had an average age of less than 23.\nHead coach Ivan Jovanovic said: “The expectations have continued to increase but the team is continuing to meet them.\n“We have a young group of players but the future is in their hands. I feel I am fortunate to have these young players available.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Scotland have suffered relegation in the Nations League after a 3-0 home defeat to Greece saw them lose their crucial play-off tie.\nThe national team had a 1-0 advantage from the first leg in Athens on Thursday but put in a lacklustre performance and were swept aside by an energetic Greek side.\nThe 3-1 aggregate defeat means Scotland have lost their League A status and will be in the second tier of the Nations League when they return to the competition next year.\nSteve Clarke decided to keep faith with the side that had earned that first-leg lead, making only one change to his starting line-up as Ryan Christie returned from suspension to replace Lewis Ferguson.\nThe manager was hoping to make the most of home advantage and find the goal that would pile pressure on Greece and make their tasks more difficult, and Scotland were on the front foot in the opening exchanges. Che Adams appealed for a penalty after a challenge in the box, then Scott McTominay had a chance saved and then a shot that nicked off a defender and rippled the side netting.\nGreece played their way into the game though, and scored with their first threatening attack after 20 minutes.\nGeorgios Vagiannidis burst down the right flank and cut the ball back into the Scotland box where Giannis Konstantelies was unmarked and able to guide a first-time finish past Craig Gordon from 10 yards out to level the tie.\nScotland looked to regain the lead quickly and John McGinn forced a save from Kostas Tzolakis after McTominay had sliced his initial effort.\nThe visitors were enjoying more of the ball though, and attacked with more energy. It paid off when they took the lead just before half-time.\nKonstantinos Karetskas was the standout player of the second half in the first leg and the 17-year-old showed his quality on his first start. Konstantelias picked him out with a pass in the box and the teenager cooly lifted the ball into the top corner of the net.\nScotland came out after the break needing something to turn their way but instead found themselves trailing further almost immediately.\nAfter just 15 seconds of play, Konstantelias pounced on a misplaced pass from Ryan Christie, played in Christos Tzolis and the winger finished cleanly to give his side a comfortable lead.\nScotland couldn’t muster a response despite a raft of changes and no little effort. The home crowd’s dissatisfaction became more vocal as the second half went on with no sign of the tie being reduced.\nThe final whistle confirmed Scotland’s relegation and boos from the crowd followed the players as they headed for the tunnel.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "A first-of-its-kind mental health support service has been launched for those working in the agricultural sector.\nFarmTalk is a collaboration between Peterhead-based charity Men United and NFU Scotland. It aims to provide peer support for the mental wellbeing of the wider farming industry and their families.\nKevin Gilbert is one of the farmers behind the initiative and understands first-hand some of the challenges.\n“You can’t take a day off, so you just get up and keep going,” he told STV News.\n“For years and years, I was like that. Every year I would take anti-depressants. When the change of season happens in the spring and the daylight lengthens you think ‘I feel better now’.\n“At the same time, when you’ve been combining busy harvesting you feel worthwhile and then you have all this backlog of office work which has built up and you go into an isolated office on your own and then start feeling down about things.”\nThe new service aims to listen and support, and says it will stand together with farmers to ensure they never face challenges alone. And now Kevin is encouraging others to speak out.\n‘‘You speak to family members, and they can’t get their sibling or partner or husband or wife to contact anybody and can’t get them to go to the doctor,’’ he added.\n‘‘We would hope that we could be that person that people could reach out and get them on the road to recovery.’’\nSince opening the mental health charity Men United, Sandy Garvock has helped to support almost 1,000 people and says 38 lives have been saved.\nComing from a farming background, he knew more support was needed for the community.\n“I felt that farmers needed somebody to speak to. Farming is a very isolated industry, when I was on the farm, I was doing 15 hours a day, seven days a week on a tractor on my own,” he said.\n“Farmers need somebody who understands and listens to what they are saying, and that’s why we launched FarmTalk,” Sandy said.\nLorna Paterson, a regional manager for NFU Scotland, says more services like this are needed now more than ever before.\n“Politics and obviously the weather plays a huge part in everybody’s life but particularly farming and for the farmers when things aren’t going well because they work on their own, they feel they have nobody to speak to,” Lorna said.\n‘‘For the farming community because they are on their own and because they have that steadfast resilient image, they feel they have to live up to that.’’\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Pope Francis returned home to the Vatican from hospital on Sunday after surviving a five-week, life-threatening bout of pneumonia, making a surprise stop at his favourite basilica on the way home before beginning two months of prescribed rest and recovery.\nThe motorcade carrying the 88-year-old pope entered the Perugino gate into Vatican City, and Francis was seen in the front passenger seat wearing nasal tubes to give him supplemental oxygen.\nDuring the trip home from Gemelli hospital, Francis took a slight detour to visit the St Mary Major basilica, where his favourite icon of the Madonna is located and where he always goes to pray after a foreign visit.\nFrancis did not leave the car, but handed a bouquet of flowers to the cardinal to place in front of the Salus populi Romani icon, a Byzantine-style painting on wood that is revered by Romans.\nEarlier, before he left the hospital, the pontiff thumbs up and acknowledged the crowd after he was wheeled out onto the balcony overlooking Gemelli’s main entry, where hundreds of people had gathered on a brilliant Sunday morning to say goodbye.\n“I see this woman with the yellow flowers. Brava!” a tired-looking Francis said. He gave a weak sign of the cross before being wheeled back inside.\nChants of “Viva il papa!” and “Papa Francesco” erupted from the crowd, which included patients who had been wheeled outside just to catch his brief appearance.\nHis blessing came minutes before he was discharged from the hospital.\nDoctors, who announced his planned discharge at a Saturday evening news conference, said he should refrain from meeting with big groups of people or exerting himself, but that eventually he should be able to resume all his normal activities.\nHis return home, after the longest hospitalisation of his 12-year papacy and the second-longest in recent papal history, brought tangible relief to the Vatican and Catholic faithful who have been anxiously following 38 days of medical ups and downs and wondering if Francis would make it.\n“Today I feel a great joy,” said Dr Rossella Russomando, a doctor from Salerno who didn’t treat Francis but was at Gemelli on Sunday. “It is the demonstration that all our prayers, all the rosary prayers from all over the world, brought this grace.”\nAt the Vatican on a brilliant spring Sunday, pilgrims flocked as they have all year to St Peter’s Basilica to participate in the 2025 Holy Year.\nThey swarmed St Peter’s Square and progressed through the Holy Door in groups, while big TV screens in the square were turned on to broadcast Francis’s hospital greeting live.\nNo special arrangements have been made at the Domus Santa Marta, the Vatican hotel next to the basilica where Francis lives in a two-room suite on the second floor.\nFrancis will have access to supplemental oxygen and 24-hour medical care as needed, though his personal physician, Dr Luigi Carbone, said he hoped Francis would progressively need less and less assistance breathing as his lungs recover.\nWhile the pneumonia infection has been successfully treated, Francis will continue to take oral medication for quite some time to treat the fungal infection in his lungs and continue his respiratory and physical physiotherapy.\n“For three or four days he’s been asking when he can go home, so he’s very happy,” Dr Carbone said.\nThe Argentine pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, was admitted to Gemelli on February 14 after a bout of bronchitis worsened.\nDoctors first diagnosed a complex bacterial, viral and fungal respiratory tract infection and soon thereafter, pneumonia in both lungs.\nDr Sergio Alfieri, the medical and surgical chief at Gemelli who coordinated Francis’s medical team, confirmed that Francis was still having trouble speaking due to the damage to his lungs and respiratory muscles.\nBut he said such problems were normal, especially in older patients, and predicted his voice would eventually return to normal.\nThe Vatican spokesman, Matteo Bruni, declined to confirm any upcoming events, including a scheduled audience on April 8 with the King or Francis’s participation in Easter services at the end of the month.But Dr Carbone said he hoped Francis might be well enough to travel to Turkey at the end of May to participate in an important ecumenical anniversary.\nFrancis is also returning to the Vatican in the throes of a Holy Year, the once-every-quarter-century celebration scheduled to draw more than 30 million pilgrims to Rome this year.\nThe pope has already missed several Jubilee audiences and will presumably miss several more, but Vatican officials say his absence hasn’t significantly impacted the numbers of expected pilgrims arriving.\nOnly St John Paul II recorded a longer time in hospital in 1981, when he spent 55 days at Gemelli for minor surgery and treatment of an infection.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Former Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman has said she “absolutely” understands the anger directed at government from those who lost someone to Covid-19.\nSpeaking on the fifth anniversary of the first lockdown being announced on Sunday, Freeman reflected on the virus which claimed more than 16,000 lives in Scotland alone and the impact of government decisions.\nAt the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, the former health secretary said she made the best decisions possible with the information available at the time, but admitted that some of the decisions could be “worth reconsidering” in hindsight.\nAsked if she understands the anger felt by families, she told the BBC’s Sunday Show: “Oh, I absolutely can.\n“I absolutely can understand their anger, of course I can.\n“That doesn’t diminish their anger, nor I’d say, does it diminish what I’m saying to you.\n“I made what I believed were the best decisions with the information I had at the time and as I could improve the circumstances, I absolutely did.”\nShe added: “But there is no getting away from the fact that people died, people were harmed and there is a long-term impact.”\nPeople were affected by long Covid, bereavement and a lack of contact with loved ones, while young people missed out on celebrating key milestones, she said.\nBut Freeman acknowledged that the decision to close schools – which sent most pupils home for the majority of the early pandemic – could have been the wrong one and many of the choices made by ministers could be worth looking at again.\n“I think it’s something worth reconsidering,” she said.\n“I don’t know, because I’m not sitting now with all the information that I had then – in five years, I don’t remember it all.\n“So I can’t say for sure that was the wrong decision.”\nShe added: “Many of them are probably worth a reconsideration and there’s certainly things to be done to prepare us to be in a better starting place than we were for the next pandemic that will come along.”\nSpeaking of her personal experience of the pandemic, Freeman – who left Holyrood in 2021 – said: “I described it as two years of running anxiety… you’re always anxious.\n“There’s anxiety about everything from whether you’re making the right decisions to whether what you’ve said needs to be done is getting done.\n“Is it getting done properly? What’s going wrong that you don’t yet know about?\n“To just anxiety that everybody had about your own relatives, loved ones, how they’re all doing, hoping they don’t get ill, hoping everything will be okay for them.”\nAsked if she felt a sense of “pride”, she said instead she was “pleased with my own resilience”.\nScottish Tory health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane accused Freeman of a “shameful” attempt to defend the government’s record, adding: “The SNP were completely unprepared for Covid and were too busy playing politics against Westminster when they should have been focused on saving lives.”\nLooking at the health service currently, Freeman went on to say that a “national booking system” for elective care could go some way to relieving the pressure on Scotland’s NHS.\nBut Scottish Labour’s deputy leader Jackie Baillie said: “Under the dysfunctional SNP, operating theatres can remain underused while A&E patients wait in corridors and nearly one in six Scots are on an NHS waiting list.\n“Scottish Labour will bring a patient-first approach to our NHS where the money follows the patient rather than propping up bureaucracy and all available operating capacity is used.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "Blue Peter has recorded its final live episode as the show moves to a pre-recorded format, the BBC said.\nAiring weekly on Fridays, the longest-running children’s show in the world began on October 16 1958 with its intrepid presenters and characterful pets.\nThe BBC said the series has been a mix of live and pre-recorded shows for decades, and it has decided to stop future live episodes “as viewing habits change”.\nThe corporation said that Blue Peter will continue to be broadcast on CBBC, BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.\nFormer Blue Peter presenters, including Richard Bacon and Simon Thomas, have expressed their upset at the news that the programme will shift away from real-time TV.\nThomas wrote on Instagram: “We probably didn’t realise it at the time, but we were working in the last years of the golden age of children’s TV, a time when children’s programmes filled the afternoons and Saturday mornings on BBC1 and ITV.\n“An era when audiences were measured in the millions rather than the thousands.\n“I don’t say golden in arrogant way; but everything has fragmented now and the way children consume entertainment has changed forever. There will never be another era like it again.”\nThe broadcaster, who is now a presenter on Sky Sports show Soccer Saturday, also said that the show gave him “incredible memories that will stay with me forever,” and “took a chance on me” when he had no experience.\nReacting to Thomas’ post on X, Bacon wrote that he “loved” Blue Peter and said “being live is what made it alive”.\n“I remember walking from one side of the studio to the other – doing a piece to camera – and seeing the whole crew, five cameras, and another on a crane, track with me,” he wrote.\n“I know that doesn’t sound like much – but the first time it happened, it was mind-blowing. It was just a big, well-made, lovingly made, really well-resourced live kids TV show.\n“That had been live in that building for decades. It was a magical experience (for, you know, all of 20 months).”\nBacon was sacked from Blue Peter in the 1990s, after admitting drug taking, but did return, receiving a Blue Peter badge on the 60th anniversary.\nA BBC spokesperson said: “Blue Peter won’t just be available to view online and will remain on the CBBC and BBC Two linear channels, as well as BBC iPlayer and sign zone.\n“The programme has been a mix of live and pre-recorded shows for decades and has transitioned to a pre-record model as viewing habits change.\n“Blue Peter continues to be loved by generations across the UK.\n“As we continue to navigate a challenging market and young audience viewing habits evolve, it is necessary to make some changes to ensure that BBC Studios Kids and Family Productions delivers a dynamic, digital-first brand that will future-proof the show and sustain its legacy for years to come.”\nThe current line-up of presenters include Shini Muthukrishnan, Joel Mawhinney and Abby Cook.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

And here in Scotland, more than 700 US-owned enterprises provide employment to more than 115,000 people.\n“Scotland is open for business and is one of the best places in the world to invest.\n“We have a reputation as a world-class entrepreneurial nation, with the number of start-ups, spinouts, and scale-up companies growing at pace.\n“We also have the potential to become a strategic hub for future renewable energy investments, specifically by developing and scaling projects in offshore wind, green hydrogen, and energy storage.\n“Tartan Week in April is a fantastic opportunity to celebrate Scottish culture and promote economic opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic.\n“I am looking forward to attending this week’s Tartan Week events, meeting our dynamic diaspora, and engaging with some of our biggest current and potential investors.\n“I want to showcase Scotland’s progressive international outlook, and our focus on innovation, sustainability and growth.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

Fishponds and rabbit hutches were also asked to be covered.\nSt Gregorys Church on Kelvindale Road was closed and the 10am service was instead held at St Charles’s at 1 Kelvinside Gardens.\nSTV News Crowds gathered to watch the demolition.

      "content_en": "Families in Tayside waiting for an autism or ADHD assessment are worried their children won’t get the support they need.\nThe health board said this week it would no longer accept referrals for diagnosis unless there is another mental health condition.\nNHS Tayside cited “extensive waiting lists” as the reason for its decision.\nIn a post on its Facebook page, NHS Tayside said: “While a formal assessment and diagnosis can provide a clearer understanding of certain patterns of behaviour, it is important to know that it is not necessary in order to access many forms of support, including additional support within school.\n“We know that navigating concerns about your child’s development can feel overwhelming, and we want to ensure you have the right support and guidance.”\nAndrew Crosbie’s grandson is waiting to be seen by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).\nBut he received a letter two days ago directing him to several other support websites.\nMr Crosbie told STV News he’s been left in the dark about how to support his grandson.\nHe said: “I don’t know if he’s misbehaving or if there is something there. I don’t know how to act with him. I don’t know if I’m giving him into trouble when I shouldn’t be giving him into trouble because it’s not his fault.”\nThe National Autistic Society, which supports hundreds of people in the Dundee and Angus area, has been inundated with calls from parents and carers since the announcement was made.\nCharleen Morton, manager of the charity’s Dundee and Angus branch, said: “It’s beyond comprehension about how they can do this to children.\n“We’ve had a few people very concerned, scared and worried about their own families and children.\n“It’s also the lack of clarity on the (social media) post about what it means for people already on the list. Are they going to be seen?”\nLong waiting lists for CAMHS isn’t unique to NHS Tayside.\nA freedom of information request by the Scottish Conservatives found it’s an issue across the country.\nMore than 400 children and young people have waited longer than three years for a neurodevelopmental assessment in Tayside.\nThe average wait for an ADHD assessment in NHS Highland is 137 weeks, while children in Ayrshire and Arran are waiting more than six years for an autism assessment.\nConservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West Alexander Burnett, convener of the Scottish Parliament’s autism group, criticised the move by NHS Tayside.\nHe said: “CAMHS is the accepted way for parents to seek a diagnosis.\n“It’s the lack of a diagnosis and the lack of the right tools that’s letting parents down.”\nNHS Tayside shared an internal briefing with STV News that states the “criteria” for the neurodevelopmental pathway has been “refined”, meaning children and young people with a co-existing mental health condition will be accepted by CAMHS.\nIt said CAMHS teams have been working with partners in the third sector, education, social work and GPs to change the focus from diagnosis to needs-based support.\nThe new policy does not apply to young people who have already had a letter of acceptance to CAMHS or the neurodevelopmental pathway.\nIt is unclear whether the halt is permanent or temporary.\nA Scottish Government spokesperson said: “We are aware of NHS Tayside’s decision to pause new referrals for a neurodevelopmental assessment to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) for children without a co-existing mental health condition.\n“This decision does not mean there is no support available for children and young people seeking a CAMHS referral in NHS Tayside, or support for their neurodivergence.\n“We’d expect the board to sensitively signpost other appropriate services, including community-based supports, that can be accessed by children and young people when a CAMHS referral is not available.”\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "A historic Aberdeen staircase once used by thousands of city mill workers could soon be restored to its former glory.\nThe century-old steps, known as Jacob’s Ladder, are currently closed due to safety concerns.\nHowever, local campaigners have renewed their long-running appeal for help to repair the steps.\nJacobs Ladder was opened to the public in 1921 to create a direct route from Don Terrace to Grandholm Bridge, ensuring quick and simple access to Granholm Mill on the other side of the river.\nThe steep steps offer a glimpse into the city’s once-thriving textile heritage when thousands of local workers made their way to and from the woollen mills every day.\nThey were acquired by James and John Crombie, and Grandholm Mill employed more than 3,000 people in 1859 to produce the world-famous cloth bearing their name.\nRosalind Walker is passionate about the ladder and what it means to local people.\nShe said: “It was very important to the war effort. Many of the overcoats worn by British officers were Crombie, and Grandholm became the largest supplier of tweed in the UK. It was a very, very important industry at the time.”\nThe stairs have since fallen into disrepair and have been closed to the public for 15 years due to structural damage.\nHowever, a local community group is renewing efforts to restore them to their former glory.\nGary Dawson from Tillydrone Community Development Trust says the closure means residents of nearby Woodside are forced to walk around Don Terrace onto Gordon Mills Road – via a steep hill with no pavements, uneven cobbles and frequent traffic.\nHe said: “We have widespread support from our host communities of Woodside and Tillydrone but also from further afield.\n“The stairs were the main gateway for workers to attend the various mills along the River Don but now are a gateway to the river and pathways themselves, which offer an escape into beautiful natural spaces on the edge of two areas that continue to host some of the highest areas of deprivation in the country.”\nThe Trust hopes to raise more than £250,000 through a crowdfunding campaign to help restore and reopen the steps.\nGary added: “People are always asking us when are the stairs going to re-open.\n“We have a new village behind us here and people can’t get access to Woodside unless they go up the street at the back, so they would be happy to use the stairs and people coming down would want to use the stairs to access the riverside and sports facilities in the village across the other side.”\nLocals say reopening the stairs will not only provide much-needed access to the river but also preserve the community’s rich heritage.\n“These stairs are so much worth fighting for, they are so important,” explained Rosalind.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",

      "content_en": "After a turbulent week in Scottish politics, former first minister Nicola Sturgeon took to the stage of the King’s Theatre in Glasgow to make her “comedy debut and comedy finale”.\nSturgeon made her Glasgow International Comedy Festival debut alongside best friend and crime author Val McDermid on Saturday night – just two days after her name was cleared in a police investigation into the SNP’s finances.\nKicking off the event, McDermid told Sturgeon: “You’re free”.\nWhile Sturgeon described the last couple of years – and weeks – as “interesting”.\nThe ex-SNP leader reflected on her resignation from politics, upcoming book and thanked her friends and supporters “from the bottom of her heart”.\n“I just wanted to say, the last few years I wouldn’t have got through without some really good pals – Val and (her wife Jo Sharp) certainly chief amongst them, but also others”, she said.\n“But also without so many of you, people I’ve never met who come along to things like this and send me messages of support.\n“So I just wanted to say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all your support.”\n“You can take the girl out of politics – which hasn’t quite happened yet – but you can’t take the politics out of the girl”, she told the crowd.\n“So when Val showed me what she was planning to say tonight about certain events this week, I had to sort of put my spin doctor hat on.”\nTouching again on politics, Sturgeon later joked that she “might change her mind” about retirement.\nSegueing into a 90-minute conversation about friendship and books, the former first minister sat beside McDermid, looking at ease as she welcomed special guests Ashley Storrie, co-creator and star of Hulu’s series Dinosaur, and Scottish crime writer Christopher Brookmyre to the show throughout.\nAt points, McDermid appeared to go off script, taking swings at Sturgeon’s political opponents, including Conservative MSP Douglas Ross – asking if Storrie’s high-pitched “I’m a wee man” comment was an imitation of him.\nAt another point, McDermid suggested Sturgeon should have “hung on to the Queen” when she died and refused to give her back “until you give [Scotland] another referendum”.\n“I thought we scored this bit of the script,” Sturgeon said, putting her head in her hands.\nMcDermid joked that Sturgeon’s upcoming memoir would have been funnier if she had ghostwritten it.\n“It would have had more jokes,” McDermid said. Sturgeon replied: “Boris Johnson is in it.”\nAs well as touching on current events, the duo discussed why reading matters and revealed the books they love and loathe.\nSTV News Nicola Sturgeon and Val McDermid’s Books and Banter event packed out the 1,785 seat King’s Theatre as part of Saturday night’s Glasgow International Comedy Festival. STV News\nThe pair talked about literature’s special power to “build bridges” and the foundational impact that libraries had on their childhood and their love of reading.\n“We’re here because we love books,” McDermid said.\nAlthough many patrons undoubtedly shared Sturgeon’s love of literature, quite a few likely wanted her to address the news surrounding her career and legacy in recent weeks.\nThey would have left disappointed as the former first minister just about managed to leave politics at the door.\nIn the end, Sturgeon declared it was both her comedy debut and finale.\nThe appearance comes two days after her name was cleared in a police investigation into the SNP’s finances.\nOn Thursday, the former first minister said she’d been “vindicated” and that there was “never a scrap of evidence” against her.\nThe news came after prosecutors gave Police Scotland guidance on what further action should be taken in the probe into the SNP’s finances.\nLast year, the force handed over its findings to the Crown and asked for direction on the next steps of the probe known as Operation Branchform.\nIn the midst of the investigation, Sturgeon’s relationship with husband Peter Murrell broke down as police investigated the finances of Scotland’s governing party.\nThe SNP power couple announced their plans to divorce in January after being estranged for some time.\nOn Thursday, Murrell appeared in court charged with the embezzlement of party funds.\nMurrell made no plea, was committed for further examination and was granted bail.\nSturgeon also recently announced that she would not seek re-election to the Scottish Parliament in 2026.\nThe crowd seemed full of Sturgeon supporters despite her status as one of Scotland’s most divisive political figures.\nSturgeon has been the longest-serving First Minister and the only woman to hold the post.\nAfter leading the country through the Covid pandemic, she became embroiled in the Operation Branchform investigation and she also endured a bitter battle on gender reforms, which many of her opponents claim have tarnished her legacy.\nSome of her critics have likely felt let down over her and the SNP’s failure to achieve Scottish independence. Others have undoubtedly felt annoyed by her continued campaigning for it.\nShe has previously defended her legacy in office. After her retirement announcement, she said she’s been “very open” about the things she’s proud of as well as the “things she could have done better”.\n“I don’t know if it’s possible to be in politics as long as I have without attracting divisive opinions,” she said.\nFollowing the Branchform investigation and her 26-year career in Holyrood, Sturgeon is turning from politics to literature – at least for a bit.\nShe will debut her first book—a memoir that promises to offer an “open, honest and candid” account of the former first minister’s “achievements” and “heartbreaks”—on August 14.\nThe personal journey called ‘Frankly’ will recount the “extraordinary events” that she has lived and led through.\nSTV News is now on WhatsApp Get all the latest news from around the country Follow STV News",
